produce pbhs are excluded . \n the @xmath44 of the original models for which inflation ends naturally generally have @xmath51 on all scales and so are unaffected by the pbh constraints . of the remaining models , in which inflation continues indefinitely in the absence of a secondary mechanism , @xmath52 are excluded by pbh overproduction \n . of the models initially generated , only approximately @xmath53 end via a secondary mechanism and do not overproduce pbhs . with an accurate numerical calculation of the perturbations \n the number of these models decreases by approximately @xmath54 . \n large positive running is now excluded as expected ( see bottom -

intensity period is marked by a photon from the @xmath133 transition , and therefore the probability density for such a transition , starting from the above reset state , is @xmath134 integration over @xmath126 gives the total transition probability , denoted by @xmath135 . \n the photon rate in a period of unit intensity is that of two dipole interacting two level systems and is given by @xcite      thus @xmath80 is given by @xmath137 in a similar way one obtains @xmath119 and @xmath78 . \n the transition rate @xmath118 can be directly read off from the no -

* ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n the circular velocity at the sun s radius has typically been established by measuring the sun s motion with respect to an object assumed to be at rest with respect to the galaxy ( sgr a@xmath2 : @xcite ; the stellar halo : @xcite ) , or by using a tracer population assumed to be angle - mixed , i.e. , having a uniform distribution of orbital phases , in a steady - state galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n recently , a competitive estimate has been obtained by a different approach using a narrow stellar stream that is assumed to be tracing out an orbit @xcite .    in this paper \n we re - analyze a new population of tracers of milky way dynamics : masers associated with star - forming regions ( * ? ? ? \n * r09 ) . using the very long baseline array ( vlba ) and \n the japanese vlbi  exploration of radio astronomy ( vera ) , precise measurements of the parallaxes , proper motions , and line - of - sight velocities of masers have been made ( see r09  and references therein ) . \n these give accurate full six - dimensional phase - space information in the disk of the galaxy . \n since these massive star - forming regions are associated with spiral arms and their shocks , the dense molecular gas regions that produce masers do not lie on exactly circular orbits , nor are they detected at random points on their orbits . \n therefore , modeling approaches that assume a uniform distribution of the orbital phases of the tracer population can not give accurate determinations of the dynamics of the galaxy . \n for the existing maser data , the problem of non - random orbital phases is exacerbated by the sparseness of the sample  only 18 masers with accurate six - dimensional phase - space information have been measured at present  and by the spatially non - uniform selection of the current sample of masers .    in this paper \n , we perform an analysis of the r09  maser data that deals simultaneously with the sparseness of the data , the spatial non - uniformity of the sampling , the non - random orbital phase distribution of masers , and prior information . assuming a flat rotation curve , @xmath7 constant \n , we use a simple model for the distribution of the maser velocities with respect to their local standards of rest : a mean offset from circular rotation @xmath8 and a general velocity dispersion tensor fixed in galactocentric cylindrical coordinates . in the probabilistic inference framework that we use  described in @xmath9  [ \n sec : data]we can marginalize over the uncertainty in the inferred distribution function of masers , take prior information on the dynamics of the galaxy into account , use the sparse data set as efficiently as possible , and then ask what information on @xmath5 the maser data provide . \n our results presented in @xmath9  [ sec : results ] show that allowing for a finite velocity dispersion tensor in the model for the maser peculiar - velocity distribution function leads to lower values of @xmath5 than the large value reported in r09 , in whose analysis the maser velocity dispersion was ( implicitly ) assumed to vanish . adding in informative prior information about @xmath10 , inferred from monitoring stellar orbits around the black hole at the center of the galaxy @xcite and from the measurement of the proper motion of sgr a@xmath2 @xcite \n , we find that the best circular velocity estimate is @xmath3 km s@xmath1 , but that the current maser data set adds little information . \n we discuss this measurement and its limitations in the light of other recent determinations in @xmath9  [ sec : discussion ] . \n throughout the analysis that follows we use the standard cylindrical galactocentric coordinate frame @xmath11 , with associated unit vectors ( @xmath12 ) pointing toward the galactic center , in the direction of galactic rotation , and toward the north galactic pole , respectively . \n the data we analyze here consist of the galactic coordinates , parallaxes , proper motions , and line - of - sight velocities of 18 galactic masers , as well as their associated uncertainties , presented in table 1 of @xcite . \n following r09 , we add a 7 km s@xmath1 uncertainty in quadrature to the uncertainties in the velocity components of each maser to describe the random , virial motion in the massive star - forming region of the individual massive star associated with each maser . \n the line - of - sight velocities have been ` corrected ' by the radio observatories pipelines for the motion of the sun with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) . \n this correction assumed a value of 20 km s@xmath1 toward @xmath13(b1900.0)= 18@xmath14 , @xmath15(b1900.0)=@xmath16 for the solar motion @xmath17 , although it is unclear whether all observatories used this standard value ( m.  reid , private communication ) . \n we undo this correction , after which the currently accepted correction for @xmath17  can be applied ; however , as we will describe below , this correction will become part of our model and , therefore , the correction for @xmath17  does not occur during the preprocessing of the data .    beyond these two corrections , \n no processing of the @xcite data has been done . \n parameter estimation in a probabilistic framework _ by necessity \n _ uses bayes s theorem to connect the probability of the model parameters given the data @xmath18 to the probability of the observed data given the model parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n this requires us ( 1 ) to identify all the parameters that need to be included in the model , ( 2 ) to write down the likelihood of the model and ( 3 ) to specify suitable priors for the model parameters . \n although the model space needs to be exhaustive , the probabilistic framework allows integration over uninteresting parameters . \n here we put forward a model for the maser kinematics in which the maser velocities are most easily modeled in galactocentric cylindrical coordinates . in order to go from the raw data described in @xmath9  [ sec : datasub ] to the velocity of each maser in galactocentric coordinates , we need to ( 1 ) correct the measured velocity for @xmath17 , ( 2 ) add to this velocity the circular velocity around the galactic center at the sun s radius , and ( 3 ) project this velocity onto the galactocentric coordinate frame ( the details of this transformation are described in the appendix of r09 ) . since the latter procedure includes \n geometrical projection factors depending on the distance @xmath10  of the sun from the galactic center , the model parameters need to include the three components of @xmath17 , @xmath10 , and @xmath5 . however , it is more practical to assume that sgr a@xmath2 is at rest with respect to the galaxy , and to use the proper motion @xmath19 of sgr a@xmath2 @xcite as a model parameter instead of the circular velocity , as @xmath19 is very tightly constrained independently of @xmath10 . \n these two parameters are related simply by multiplying the proper motion of sgr a@xmath2 by @xmath10 and correcting this for @xmath17 . \n the circular velocity then becomes a parameter derived from the actual model parameters , which is no problem in the probabilistic framework , where it is easy to propagate uncertainties correctly . as we will assume that the rotation curve is flat , no extra parameters to model the shape of the rotation curve need to be included in the model . \n if we had uniformly sampled the phase space of masers and full prior knowledge of the phase - space distribution function of massive star - forming regions , this would uniquely specify the likelihood of the model , as the probability of the measured position and velocity of each maser would simply be given by the distribution function of the masers convolved with the observational uncertainty . \n however , we have neither a uniform sample of masers nor much prior information about the distribution of masers throughout the galaxy . to account for the spatial non - uniformity of the sample we will focus on the distribution of velocities at the actually observed position of the maser , instead of using the full six - dimensional phase - space distribution function to evaluate the likelihood . \n for this distribution we will assume that it only depends on the peculiar velocity @xmath20 of the maser in galactocentric cylindrical coordinates . \n we will assume that this distribution of peculiar velocities is given by a gaussian distribution characterized by a mean , a 3-vector @xmath21 , the offset from circular motion , and a general velocity dispersion tensor , a symmetric @xmath22 tensor @xmath23 with six free parameters . \n since there have been no measurements of either the mean offset from circular motion of the masers or their velocity dispersion , we will use flat priors on these quantities . \n this model is essentially a generalization of the model used in @xcite where the velocity dispersion tensor was assumed to vanish ; this was a poor assumption as we will show below . \n the probability of a single maser is thus given by @xmath24|{\\ensuremath{\\overline{{{\\boldsymbol{{\\mathbf{v}}}}}}}},{\\ensuremath{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\sigma$}}}\\right)\\otimes p({{\\boldsymbol{{\\mathbf{x}}}}},{{\\boldsymbol{{\\mathbf{v}}}}}|{{\\boldsymbol{{\\mathbf{x}}}}_i}^{\\mathrm{obs}},{{\\boldsymbol{{\\mathbf{v}}}}_i}^{\\mathrm{obs}})\\,,\\ ] ] where we have suppressed the dependence of @xmath25 on the dynamical parameters , and where the convolution with the observational uncertainty distribution @xmath26 has been included . \n the posterior distribution for the 14 model parameters is then given by @xmath27 where the first factor on the right - hand side is the prior probability distribution for these parameters and the product is the likelihood . \n we have used flat priors for @xmath21 and @xmath23 , which is why they do not appear explicitly . \n for @xmath19 we use a gaussian prior with a mean of 30.24 km s@xmath1 kpc @xmath1 and a standard deviation of 0.12 km s@xmath1 kpc@xmath1 @xcite . for @xmath10 \n we combine current state - of - the - art determinations of @xmath10  from galactic center orbits with equal weights : 8.0 @xmath28 0.6 kpc found by @xcite and 8.33 @xmath28 0.35 kpc found by @xcite . \n this prior is shown as the gray curve in  [ fig : ro ] . for @xmath17 \n we use the value and uncertainties obtained from _ hipparcos _ \n data @xcite , although the clumpiness of the velocity distribution of nearby stars @xcite implies an uncertainty more on the order of a few km s@xmath1 in the value of @xmath17  ( j.  bovy & d.  w.  hogg , in preparation ) . \n the implied prior for the circular velocity is shown as the thick gray curve in  [ fig : thetao ] . to investigate how informative the maser measurements are about @xmath5 and @xmath10 \n , we will consider the effect of dropping ( some combination of ) these priors below . \n the framework described here can easily be generalized to more general descriptions of the distribution of the peculiar velocities of the masers . in what follows \n we will use a distribution function that is the sum of two gaussian distributions , the second having half of the weight and twice the dispersion of the first gaussian , to determine the possible effect of outliers .      in order to explore the posterior distribution for all of the model parameters in light of the maser data we use a simple markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method @xcite . \n this procedure is described in some detail in the appendix .    the practical complication in evaluating the likelihood given in equations  ( [ eq : onelike ] ) and ( [ eq : posterior ] ) for each of the masers comes from the fact that the observational uncertainties are gaussian in the space of observed quantities  more specifically , for the parallax  but are non - gaussian in the space of the peculiar velocities . however , if the relative parallax uncertainty is small ( @xmath29percent ) we can confidently propagate the uncertainties to the space of peculiar velocities , where the convolution of the gaussian velocity distribution model for the peculiar velocities with the observational gaussian uncertainty distribution is simple . \n a few of the masers have relative parallax uncertainties larger than 10percent , but we have nonetheless propagated the uncertainties in the gaussian approximation . to check that this does not bias our results \n we have also run our analysis using a full numerical convolution with the actual observational uncertainties and we find results that are barely distinguishable from the results presented below . \n the main scientific goal of this paper is to understand what the maser measurements tell us about @xmath5 . \n the posterior probability distribution for @xmath5 , fully marginalized over all of the parameters of the maser distribution function , the solar motion with respect to the lsr , the distance to the galactic center , and the proper motion of sgr a@xmath2 , is shown in  [ fig : thetao ] . \n the analogously marginalized posterior distribution for @xmath10  is shown in  [ fig : ro ] . \n also shown in  [ fig : thetao ] is the posterior we obtained when we drop the informative prior on @xmath19 . \n the posterior distributions for the proper motion of sgr a@xmath2 and for the components of @xmath17  are not shown here . \n they are all basically identical to their prior distributions , implying that the masers  not surprisingly  cannot inform us about these quantities .    while the prior on @xmath5 in  [ fig : thetao ] peaks at 244 km s@xmath1 with a 1sigma uncertainty of 16 km s@xmath1 , the posterior for @xmath5 is peaked at a value of 244 km s@xmath1 with a 1sigma uncertainty of about 13 km s@xmath1 . \n this equal value for @xmath5 after analyzing the masers is in qualitative contrast to the initial analysis of r09 , who found that it raised the peak to 254 km s@xmath1 . \n this difference arises mainly from our more general model for the distribution function of the masers . \n if we insist within our analysis that the velocity dispersion of the masers is zero , we find a posterior distribution for the circular velocity that is peaked at 255 km s@xmath1 , in rough agreement with the r09  results . \n the light gray line in  [ fig : thetao ] shows what happens when we drop the informative prior on @xmath19 , while keeping the @xmath10 prior : @xmath0 km s@xmath1 . \n this and the fact that the posterior probability is barely narrower than the prior , tells us that the current maser measurements have not much power to constrain @xmath5 . \n the posterior estimate for the distance to the galactic center is @xmath30 kpc ; this shows that the masers lead to a small improvement to our knowledge of the sun s distance to the galactic center . without the informative prior on @xmath19 the posterior estimate for @xmath10 \n is the same as the prior estimate : @xmath31 kpc .    at the same time \n , the mcmc procedure provides fully marginalized posterior distributions for the parameters of the conditional velocity distribution function of masers , which are given in  [ fig : dist ] : shown are the posterior distributions for the three components of the mean offset from circular velocity of the masers , i.e. , the mean peculiar velocity , in cylindrical coordinates ( toward the galactic center , in the direction of galactic rotation , and toward the north galactic pole ) as well as for the trace of the velocity dispersion tensor . from this \n we confirm the mean lag of 15 km s@xmath1we find a lag of @xmath32 km s@xmath1of the masers with respect to their local standards of rest previously found by r09 . \n [ fig : dist ] shows that the masers have a mean velocity toward the galactic center of @xmath33 km s@xmath1 . \n taken together , these mean peculiar velocities imply that the masers are typically just past the apocenter of their orbits . \n we also find a mean velocity component of @xmath34 km s@xmath1 in the direction toward the north galactic pole .    from the posterior distribution for the trace of the velocity dispersion tensor \n we see that the masers have a relative large velocity dispersion@xmath35 km s@xmath1]@xmath37larger than might be expected from a comparison with the velocity dispersion of young stars in the solar neighborhood , whose trace is about [ 14 km s@xmath1]@xmath37 @xcite . \n since we put no restrictions on the form of @xmath23 we also obtain posterior probability distributions for all of the components of @xmath23 : for the diagonal components we find @xmath38 km s@xmath1 , @xmath39 km s@xmath1 , and @xmath40 km s@xmath1 . as we discuss below \n , the fact that we obtain these large values could be because our model for the conditional velocity distribution is too restrictive .    in order to assess the possible affect of outliers on our inference , \n we have performed the same analysis assuming a distribution of the peculiar velocities which consists of a mixture of two gaussian distributions , identical in every aspect except that the second gaussian has half of the weight and twice the dispersion of the first gaussian ( by doubling each component of the velocity dispersion tensor ) . \n we find the same posterior distributions for the dynamical parameters and the mean offset ; the inferred dispersion of the masers is , predictably , somewhat smaller : the trace of the covariance matrix peaks at [ 22 km s@xmath1]@xmath37 . \n two specific candidate outliers , the sources ngc 7538 and g 23.6 - 0.1 , were identified and removed from the sample by r09 , because they displayed large post - fit residuals . to assess whether these two sources affect our results significantly , the same analysis as described above of the r09  basic sample of 16 masers was performed , leaving out the sources ngc 7538 and g  23.6 - 0.1 . \n we find basically the same result : @xmath41 km s@xmath1 . \n thus , as opposed to r09 , who found that these two sources significantly raise the circular velocity derived from the maser data , our result is robust with respect to their inclusion . \n we have re - analyzed the recent maser kinematics from r09 , to see what they tell us about @xmath42 and the maser orbits . \n our analysis differs from that of r09  by allowing for a more general model for the distribution of the velocities of the masers with respect to their local standards of rest , by using a proper probabilistic framework that includes proper marginalization over uninteresting parameters , and by the explicit inclusion of suitable prior information . from this \n , we find an estimate of @xmath5 of @xmath43 km s@xmath1 , the same value as the mode of our prior , and substantially lower than the estimate of r09 . \n our analysis has also shown that the current maser measurements have only limited power to constrain @xmath5 beyond the prior ; dropping the prior coming from the measured proper motion of sgr a@xmath2 we find @xmath0 km s@xmath1 ; further dropping the prior information on @xmath10 , the maser data provide no constraint on @xmath5 at all . \n the value for @xmath5 that we have inferred in this paper from the kinematics of galactic masers compares favorably with other recent measurements of the circular velocity . as is clear from  [ fig : thetao ] \n , the posterior probability distribution for the circular velocity is peaked at about the same value as the prior probability distribution obtained from combining the precise measurements of the distance to the galactic center , the proper motion of sgr a@xmath2 , and the solar motion in the direction of galactic rotation . \n it is also consistent with the value of @xmath44 km s@xmath1 from a recent measurement based on the completely different principle of fitting an orbit to the gd-1 stellar stream @xcite . combining these estimates by inverse variance weighting we find a value for the circular velocity of @xmath45 km s@xmath1 . \n the results in this paper are unaffected by the uncertainty in the value of the solar motion with respect to the lsr . \n if we use a larger uncertainty in the value of @xmath46 of 3 km s@xmath1 in each component , as suggested by an analysis of the effect of moving groups on @xmath46 ( j.  bovy & d.  w.  hogg , in preparation ) , we retrieve the same estimate @xmath47 km @xmath1 as before . \n even when we use an uncertainty of 15 km s@xmath1 in the value of each component of @xmath46 , we find a slight increase in the uncertainty , but still the same value @xmath48 km s@xmath1 . \n thus , the uncertainty in @xmath46 only affects our conclusions if it is larger than about 10 km s@xmath1 . \n we also learned that the masers on average lag @xmath5 and are moving toward the galactic center . \n this fact is illustrated in s  [ fig : dist ] and [ fig : phases ] , where the orbital phases of the masers are shown for a logarithmic potential @xmath49 ( e.g. , equation  ( 3.14 ) in * ? ? ? \n * ) assuming @xmath50 kpc and @xmath51 km s@xmath1 . \n this will be interesting to analyze in the context of spiral shock models . \n our analysis implies that the present maser data do not lead to a substantive improvement of our knowledge of @xmath10  and @xmath5 , as most of the information in the data is spent on determining the properties of the conditional velocity distribution of the masers . \n it is also remarkable that , given all of the prior information , the masers are much more informative about @xmath10  than they are about the angular rotation speed at the sun s radius , as the posterior distribution for @xmath52 is barely distinguishable from the prior distribution .    despite the fact that most of the information content in the maser data is already being used to infer the distribution function , it is possible that our model for the distribution function is not general enough . \n for one , it is very likely that the distribution function of the masers depends on the galactocentric radius and , in particular , that the mean velocity offset in the direction toward the galactic center depends on radius . \n indeed , there is some indication of that already in our results , as the large velocity dispersion of the masers is mostly driven by a large velocity dispersion in the direction toward the galactic center ; this could be due to an unmodeled radial dependence of the distribution function . \n the measurement of the dynamics of the galaxy performed here uses a tracer population that is obviously non - angle mixed but has no unambiguous non - angle - mixed interpretation  such as a stellar stream tracing out an orbit . \n such a measurement has the fundamental problem that structure in the distribution function of the tracers is , in a sense , exchangeable with complexity of the potential . \n therefore , detailed measurements of the potential of the galaxy using larger samples of masers will very likely be fundamentally limited by our lack of knowledge about the distribution function of the masers . as more masers with precise \n kinematic information become available  as many as 400 are possible over the next few years ( m.  reid , private communication)more detailed inferences of the distribution function will have to be made simultaneously with more precise measurements of the potential of the galaxy from these masers . \n the method described and used in this paper is flexible enough to handle these more general distribution functions and more general models for the potential of the galaxy . \n it is a pleasure to thank dustin lang , mark reid , and scott tremaine for

to give samples from the posterior .    as proposal distributions we use : \n ( 1 ) the prior for the components of @xmath17 , ( 2 ) a gaussian for @xmath10  and @xmath19 centered on the current values with widths of 0.5 kpc and 0.12 km s@xmath1 kpc@xmath1 , respectively , ( 3 ) a gaussian for the mean offset centered on the current values with a width of @xmath60 km s@xmath1 for each

The observations were taken with the WFPC2 instrument in the F555W and F814W filters, and the data were analyzed to derive the IMF down to very low stellar masses and to study the effect of metallicity on the LFs. The study aims to provide clues to the physics of star formation by searching for a systematic dependence of the IMF on some parameter. The results show that the field stars of the galactic thick disk and halo have a luminosity function that is not significantly different from that of the solar neighborhood down to masses near the hydrogen burning limit, and that the IMF breaks away from an approximate power-law increase below 0.5 M\u2609. The study also finds that the luminosity function shows a broad maximum near M_V = 5, and that the underlying mass function breaks away from an approximate power-law increase below 0.5 M\u2609.

The article focuses on low mass stars and states that surveys have provided a well-determined measure of the field star luminosity function near the sun. However, extensive modeling is required to derive the corresponding stellar IMF. Recent surveys suggest that the field stars of the galactic thick disk and halo have a luminosity function similar to that of the solar neighborhood, despite differences in density and chemical abundance. The article also discusses the challenges and uncertainties in determining the initial mass of stars, particularly in field star analyses. The authors note that studying open clusters can help remove some of these uncertainties, but most available clusters are young, and there is a need for older clusters covering a range of metallicities. The article mentions recent improvements in data on the low mass end of the stellar luminosity function from observations of globular clusters with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The authors report their own observations of two open clusters, which extend the metallicity range represented by globular clusters and allow for the study of metallicity effects on stellar luminosity functions.

main sequence stars of low mass are not yet well tested . \n ideally , one wants clusters older than perhaps 1 gyr , covering a wide range of metallicities .    in the past year \n there has been a vast improvement in the quality and quantity of data on the low mass end of the stellar luminosity function ( lf ) from observations of globular clusters with the refurbished hst ( e.g.  elson _ et al . _  1995 \n ; de marchi & paresce 1995a , 1995b ; paresce , de marchi & romaniello 1995 ) . \n these four globular cluster studies have already provided good stellar lfs to @xmath6 ( @xmath2 0.2 m@xmath1 ) , and they will soon be supplemented by at least seven more hst globular cluster studies . in this paper \n we report deep hst observations of the lfs in two open clusters , which allow us to extend the metallicity range represented by these four globular clusters ( @xmath7 < -0.7 $ ] ) up to solar abundance . thus , for the first time we now have cluster luminosity functions extending to very low stellar masses and covering more than 2 dex in metallicity , and can therefore study the effect of metallicity on stellar luminosity functions . in this paper \n we search for a systematic dependence of the imf on some parameter to provide clues to the physics of star formation . \n we observed the open clusters ngc 2477 and ngc 2420 with hst on 1994 march 18 and 1994 may 18/19 , respectively , using the wfpc2 along with the f555w ( approximately v - band ) and f814w ( approximately i - band ) filters . \n our observations were taken 5.2 arc minutes sw of the cluster center ( 7:38:11.2 + 21:33:09.7 , j2000.0 ) for ngc 2420 and 2.7 arc minutes wsw of the cluster center ( 7:52:16.8 -38:35:40.1 , j2000.0 ) for ngc 2477 to avoid the brightest stars in each cluster . \n these fields still contain many very bright stars so we obtained the cumulative one hour exposures in each filter from nine 400s exposures in ngc 2477 and four 900s exposures in ngc 2420 . \n all data were acquired in the same manner and with the same filters , although the operating temperature of the ccds was @xmath8c during the march observations and @xmath9c during the may observations . \n the temperature change was made in order to decrease a charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) problem which manifested itself as a position - dependent non - linearity of the wfpc2 ccds . \n the effect was found to be @xmath2 10% at @xmath8c and @xmath2 4% at @xmath9c ( holtzman _ et al . _ \n 1995b ) in a series of 40 second calibration exposures taken of a field in @xmath4 cen . \n elevated sky counts found in longer exposures such as ours are expected to decrease the cte problem ( holtzman _ et al . _ \n the lower operating temperature also resulted in far fewer ` hot pixels ' ; pixels with an elevated dark count lasting for hours or days . finally , an additional difference between our two cluster observations is that the sky level for the may data was five times higher than for the march data , owing to zodiacal light differences . \n the raw data were reprocessed using the iraf / stsdas software with the updated calibration frames that became available subsequent to the observations . \n this included the standard statistical corrections to the analogue to digital conversion , bias subtraction , dark count subtraction , flat fielding and geometric distortion correction . \n we also included the non - standard `` ramp correction '' for the march cte problem . \n the cte properties of the wfpc2 are still not entirely understood , but applying the correction reduced the significance of the cte effect to @xmath2 1% . \n the cte effect in the may data is expected to be @xmath10 1% because of the higher sky counts and the cooler ccds , so we did not attempt to apply a correction for these data . \n additionally we spent great effort trying to identify hot pixels as measured in the dark frames taken shortly before or after our observations , but were largely unsuccessful owing to the short life - times of these hot pixels . \n since hot pixels have counts which are independent of the filter in use , and thus have color equal to zero on the instrumental system , they appear in the same region of the color - magnitude ( cm ) diagram as the faintest white dwarfs . \n since the wfpc2 ccds are undersampled , hot pixels may appear like faint stars , especially two adjacent hot pixels or single hot pixels next to positive sky fluctuations . \n hot pixels thus decreased our limiting magnitude for white dwarfs ( von hippel _ et al . _ \n 1995 , hereafter paper i ) , but did not affect the limiting magnitude for the coolest main sequence stars , the subject of this paper . \n we performed aperture photometry using 1.5 pixel radius apertures with aperture corrections based on a detailed study of the many bright stars available in our fields . \n after some experimenting we did not employ point spread function ( psf ) fitting photometry as our fields were uncrowded and the psf was positionally dependent and not well characterized by our stars . unlike paper \n i , the photometry was directly transformed to the standard johnson - cousins vi system using the calibration from holtzman _ \n et al . _  ( 1995b ) . \n the photometry we present here is thus slightly different from that presented in paper i , but the differences are so small for the white dwarfs as not to modify the results of that study . \n the cm diagrams for all the stars in the fields of both our clusters , with galaxies removed , are presented in figures 1 and 2 .      in order to characterize the completeness of our photometry we created synthetic stars using the tinytim hst psf generation package ( krist 1994 ) , added these stars to our data , and then tried to recover them using our standard finding and photometry procedure . \n the synthetic stars were created for both the f555w and f814w filters and were centered at 16 different sub - pixel positions and laid down in a grid of positions covering the whole of each ccd . \n this sub - pixel sampling was done since the psf locations affect the number of pixels under the psf , and thus the sky noise and read noise contributions per pixel cause the limiting magnitude to depend on the psf sub - pixel position . \n since this effect is based on noise changing systematically with psf position , it affects completeness , but not the measured magnitudes of objects bright enough to find . \n the resulting simulated noise - free stars were scaled and had noise added to them to mimic stars over a range of magnitudes . from this procedure \n we estimated our completeness levels , which are superimposed on figures 1 and 2 . \n these completeness levels lead to a limiting magnitude @xmath2 0.5 magnitudes brighter than initially expected for the refurbished hst , but this is now understood as due to the ccds leaking some charge between adjacent pixels ( holtzman _ et al . _ \n these estimates of completeness should be reasonably accurate for the redder stars where hot pixels are not a problem . \n we outline here the remaining sources of uncertainty in our photometry , although we emphasize that these are all small effects which do not affect our results . \n \\1 ) the cte corrections are almost surely not perfect for the @xmath8c data and they have not been attempted for the @xmath9c data . \n the resulting uncertainties are @xmath2 1% and do not contribute to any important systematics . \n \\2 ) the hst pipeline flats were taken at the gain=14 setting , whereas our data were taken at the gain=7 setting . \n the relative gains between these two settings are not identically 2.0 for all ccds . \n the appropriate gain ratios have been applied , but these are uncertain to @xmath2 1% each . \n this source of uncertainty should not cause systematic errors since all three wf ccds contain nearly equal portions of the cluster cm diagram . \n \\3 ) the hst pipeline flats are good to a few percent , pixel - to - pixel , over most of the area of the ccds . \n \\4 ) we applied a single aperture correction to all photometry for all wf ccds . \n in fact the relatively large number of bright but isolated stars in our images allowed us to investigate a number of subtle instrumental effects in the photometry . \n we performed a number of such tests , and compared them with simulations based on tinytim analytical psfs . \n the results are described in detail in tanvir , robinson & von hippel ( 1995 ) but briefly they found that ( a ) the photometry is essentially unaffected by the position of the center of the star within a pixel , and ( b ) there is a small ( @xmath113% ) variation seen in the ngc 2477 small aperture photometry which correlates with position on the ccd . \n this latter effect is probably due to small variations in the psf across each ccd . \n a similar but not identical effect is seen in the simulations , while ngc 2420 has too few bright stars to show it . \n however , given that this effect is small , is uncorrelated with magnitude , and to first order affects v and i in the same way , thus leaving v - i colors unchanged , it makes a negligible difference to the results presented here and so no correction was made . \n \\5 ) the precision of the holtzman _ \n et al . _  ( 1995b ) transformation is expected to be @xmath2 2% , over the applicable color range . \n the range of applicability of the holtzman _ \n et al . _  photometric transformations \n is @xmath12 v - i @xmath13 , whereas our stars continue to v - \n i @xmath2 3.5 . \n the expected error for the reddest stars is not large ( see section 3 ) , but this is probably our single greatest systematic uncertainty . \n \\6 ) whitmore ( 1995 ) reports that the hst + wfpc2 throughput increased by 4.1% in f555w and by 0.6% in f814w after cooling the wfpc2 ccds to @xmath9c on 24 april 1994 . \n et al . _  ( 1995b ) report similar numbers . \n since the photometric zero points were determined after the ccds were cooled , corrections need to be applied to the earlier data , in our case to ngc 2477 . \n most of the throughput differences seem to be due to the decrease in the cte problem ( ferguson , private communication ) , however , and since we make a cte correction for our ngc 2477 data , much of this zero point difference probably disappears . \n the zero point difference between cte corrected data has not yet been determined . \n we therefore have not applied any throughput correction to the ngc 2477 data . \n thus , our ngc 2477 data may suffer an additional @xmath2 2 - 5% systematic error in v - i .    from items 1 through 5 above \n we estimate that the additional random error contributed by the instrument , above and beyond that produced by photon counting statistics , is likely to be 4 - 5% , largely independent of magnitude . \n item number 5 is relevant to the color magnitude diagrams presented in figures 1a , b and 2a , b as well as to any comparison of these data in the transformed johnson - cousins system to models . it does not affect our analysis of cluster luminosity functions as we compare our data to other hst observations taken through the same filters \n also , these additional noise sources are not included in the cm diagram error bars , which represent only the internal photon -

band completeness levels are nearly horizontal , being curved slightly due to the color term in the photometric transformations . \n likewise the i - band completeness levels are at a near - constant value in i , and thus inclined in this cm diagram . \n the saturation limits are indicated by the upper dotted lines , level for v and inclined for i. the reddening vector for each cluster is plotted at v @xmath2 22 and v - i @xmath2 0.6 . \n examination of these figures shows that the main sequence stars and white dwarfs clearly stand out in both clusters , even in the relatively crowded field of ngc 2477 ( which has galactic latitude @xmath21 = @xmath22 ) . \n it is also evident that the completeness simulations are consistent with the photometric errors and the faint limit of the photometry . \n figures 2a and 2b present the cluster photometry after the effects of distance and reddening have been removed , and after the removal of the obvious contaminating field stars . \n the dashed lines are eye - ball fits to the monet _ \n et al . _  ( 1992 ) trigonometric data for white dwarfs and solar metallicity main sequence stars . \n they are plotted here to demonstrate that the entire combination of extrapolated photometric transformations , measured distances , and reddenings are reasonable for these clusters . \n figure 2b presents the fits to the monet _ \n et al._data placed for e(b - v ) = 0.2 , 0.3 and 0.4 ( left to right ) , since this cluster is known to have variable reddening . \n contaminating field stars were removed by comparison with nearby fields observed by the hst medium deep survey project . \n the medium deep survey cm diagrams ( santiago , private communication ) were derived from f606w and f814w photometry , so we used the transformations derived by elson _ \n et al . _  ( 1995 ) to convert to the johnson - cousins colors . \n a detailed comparison was then made of the number of stars as a function of magnitude and color in one nearby field for ngc 2420 and two comparable fields for ngc 2477 . \n the comparison field for ngc 2420 is at _ l , b _ \n = 206 , + 19.6 , whereas ngc 2420 is at _ l , b _ = 198 , + 19.7 . \n the comparison field has a similar , and nearly negligible , reddening , e(b - v ) = 0.02 ( burstein & heiles 1982 ) . \n two comparison fields were used for ngc 2477 since none yet exist which closely match its galactic position and reddening . \n one field is at _ l , b _ = 85 , \n -3.5 and has e(b - v ) @xmath3 0.39 , whereas the other is at _ l , b _ \n = 202 , + 9 and has e(b - v ) @xmath3 0.18 ( burstein & heiles 1982 ) . \n ngc 2477 is at _ l , b _ \n = 254 , -5.8 . using this procedure \n we found it straightforward to isolate the main sequence cluster stars from the contaminating foreground and background stars , most of which lie well away from the main sequences . \n a few stars in the comparison fields do lie on the cluster main sequences , and thus a small proportion of the stars presented in figures 2a and 2b are expected not to be cluster members . \n these can only be removed statistically , so no corrections were applied to figures 2a and 2b , though the statistical corrections were applied to the cluster main sequence lfs presented below . before moving on to the extracted cluster lfs , it is worth pointing out that the main sequence in ngc 2420 ( figure 2a ) may actually stop at @xmath23 @xmath2 12 ( @xmath0 @xmath2 9.5 ) , as the fainter stars lie somewhat off the expected main sequence locus . \n since we argue below that this cluster lf peaks at @xmath23 @xmath2 11.5 ( @xmath0 @xmath2 9.0 ) , for the present purposes we make the conservative assumption that these stars are cluster members . \n the main sequences lfs for ngc 2420 and ngc 2477 are plotted in figures 3a and 3b . \n the star symbols are the raw lfs , and the open circles are the lfs corrected for field star contamination and incompleteness . also plotted are lines representing the fractional incompleteness based on our synthetic star simulations . \n the fractional incompleteness rises from @xmath2 0% at @xmath0 = 10 to nearly 100% by @xmath0 = 11.5 . in all subsequent use of the cluster lfs \n we include only portions of the lf where incompleteness is less than 25% . \n the ngc 2420 lf ( figure 3a ) turns over at @xmath0 @xmath2 9.0 while the ngc 2477 lf ( figure 3b ) seems to flatten at @xmath0 @xmath3 9.5 . \n the numbers of stars in these lfs are small , being only 19 and 53 stars in the complete portion of the lfs for ngc 2420 and ngc 2477 , respectively , so these lf shapes are currently only suggestive . \n we can estimate the likelihood that the ngc 2420 lf does not turn over by evaluating the probability that the value of the lf in the final bin is actually greater than the identified peak . for ngc 2420 \n a turn - over is a 1.5 @xmath20 result , i.e. there is a 7% chance that this lf continues to rise to its measured limit . \n the likelihood that the lf continues to rise as rapidly after @xmath0 @xmath2 9.0 as it did before this point is only 1% , however , since the last lf bin lies 2.3 @xmath20 below such an extrapolation . for ngc 2477 a turn - over \n is not seen , and a flattening is only suggestive . \n we thus locate the peak in this lf at , or after , @xmath0 = 9.5 . \n we proceed below to consider the implications of these lf shapes , assuming that they have been correctly determined .    in figure 4 \n we plot our open cluster lfs along with the solar neighborhood lf presented in kroupa _ \n et al . _  ( 1993 ) and the four published hst globular cluster lfs : @xmath4 cen ( elson _ et al . _ \n 1995 ) , 47 tuc ( de marchi & paresce 1995b ) , m 15 ( de marchi & paresce 1995a ) , and ngc 6397 ( paresce , de marchi & romaniello 1995 ) . the four globular cluster lfs have been shifted down by 1 to 2 units in the log to approximately match the open cluster number counts , for ease of presentation . \n since all the hst results were obtained using the f814w filter with wfpc2 , we choose to plot the lfs directly in terms of f814w magnitudes , and have therefore transformed the kroupa _ \n et al . _  ( 1993 ) data first to @xmath0 using the trigonometric parallax data of dahn _ et al . _  ( 1995 ) , and then to @xmath24 . \n error bars are not plotted here for clarity , but the globular cluster lfs are well determined with typically many hundreds of stars per bin near the lf peak . \n error bars due to poisson statistics are large for our open cluster data and can be readily determined either in this figure or in figures 3a and 3b by reference to the vertical scale .    in figure 5 we plot the location of the turn - over of all the lfs of figure 4 with respect to their metallicity , measured in [ fe / h ] . \n the location of a lf turn - over is defined as the location of the peak bin , or for the case of @xmath4 cen , the location of the first bin of the lf flattening . \n the solar neighborhood value has been placed at [ fe / h ] = @xmath250.2 , representative of this sample ( wyse & gilmore 1996 ) . \n the abundance distribution of the field stars ( unlike the clusters which each have a single abundance ) blurs any sharp features in its lf , so that the lf maxima discussed here are less precisely defined for the solar neighborhood . \n the error in the turn - over magnitude for the solar neighborhood is @xmath2 0.25 magnitudes , while the error in the turn - over magnitude for ngc 2420 is larger , @xmath2 0.5 magnitudes . \n the turn - over magnitude for ngc 2477 is plotted as a lower limit . \n the internal errors in the turn - over magnitudes for the globular clusters are small because of the large number of stars in each bin . \n the errors in the turn - over magnitudes are thus likely dominated by the distance uncertainties for these clusters , which are @xmath2 0.2 magnitudes ( e.g. elson _ et al . _ \n we do not plot the location of the turn - over in the very broad halo field star lf as given by dahn _ \n _  ( 1995 ) in figure 5 , as the location of this peak is probably more uncertain than the other lf peaks . \n the essential result which is evident in figure 5 is a smooth and well defined correlation between the location of the turnover of the luminosity function of a stellar sample and the metallicity of that stellar sample . while we discuss explanations of this correlation below , we note here that it bears a close resemblance to a theoretical constant - mass locus . \n such loci are plotted in figure 5 as dashed lines from the low mass star models of saumon ( private communication ) , for masses @xmath26 and @xmath27 m@xmath1 , and as solid lines from the low mass star models of alexander _ et al . _  ( 1996 ) , for masses @xmath26 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 m@xmath1 . \n the saumon models are plotted in @xmath0 , rather than @xmath24 , but the differences are expected to be minor . \n in the preceding sections we have concentrated on the cluster luminosity functions , not the mass functions , since the derivation of the latter requires additional assumptions . indeed , \n et al . _  ( 1995 ) , in their analysis of @xmath4 cen , show that even small uncertainties in the mass - luminosity relation are enough to cause major changes in the derived mass function slope . \n dantona & mazzitelli ( 1996 ) also demonstrate that the faint star lf slope has little to do with the mf slope , or metallicity , as it is driven by the slope of the mass - luminosity relation . while theoretical models for low mass stars are rapidly improving ( see alexander _ et al . _  1996 ; dantona & mazzitelli 1996 ) , a number of difficulties still remain at solar metallicities . \n we therefore chose not to convert these lfs to mfs , but rather to follow the dominant lf feature , the turn - over , and compare it with stellar models . by following the lf turn - overs we are able to see that all available lfs look essentially the same , especially when corrected for the metallicity of the population . \n all lfs have approximately the same shape , and each has a turn - over at @xmath30 m@xmath1 \n . why might all lfs have turn - overs at the same mass value , and what physical phenomena might affect the turn - over ? \n we look at the effects of dynamics , the mass - luminosity relation , and the imf slope in turn . \n in analyzing their globular cluster luminosity functions , de marchi & paresce ( 1995a , 1995b ) argue that while these three globular clusters have undergone different degrees of core collapse and tidal stripping , their observed lfs are relatively insensitive to the cluster dynamical histories since they were obtained near the cluster half - mass radii . \n our open cluster observations were also made well inside the radii of tidal stripping , 3 pc from the center of ngc 2420 and 1 pc from the center of ngc 2477 . \n these distances should be compared to the tidal radius for ngc 2420 , which was determined to be @xmath3 18 pc by leonard ( 1988 ) . \n the tidal radius for ngc 2477 has not been determined to the best of our knowledge , but these clusters are similar in their stellar density and distance from the galactic center . additionally , although ngc 2420 has a relaxation time of only @xmath2 @xmath31 yrs , it shows only marginally significant mass segregation ( leonard 1988 ) . \n furthermore , since the globular clusters have a mean stellar density a factor @xmath32 to @xmath33 times higher than the open clusters ( compare the densities of leonard 1988 with those of webbink 1985 ) , and are approximately an order of magnitude older , it would require careful tuning of the dynamical histories of these clusters for low mass stellar evaporation to produce , just at the present time , an uncoordinated set of changes which mimic a systematic dependence on metallicity . in any case , several more globular clusters have been observed with hst , so additional information to check the importance of dynamical evolution , and the true scatter in the correlation of figure 5 , will soon be available . \n we do not argue that these clusters have not undergone possibly very different dynamical histories , only that their dynamical histories are not the primary cause of the lf turn - overs . \n the slope of the mass - luminosity ( ml ) relation , in both v and i , is rapidly increasing at masses lower than @xmath30 m@xmath1 , independent of metallicity ( alexander _ et al . _  1996 ; dantona & mazzitelli 1996 ) . \n metallicity does cause an offset in luminosity at a given mass , but it only slightly affects the slope of the ml relation at a given mass ( alexander _ et al . _ \n this increase of slope in the ml relation causes a given mass increment to cover a larger and larger absolute magnitude increment , especially below m@xmath34 @xmath2 9.5 - 10 . \n thus a turn - over in the lf at these magnitudes is naturally explained by the rapidly steepening ml relation . \n this point was appreciated by kroupa _ \n et al . _  ( 1993 ) \n for the solar neighborhood lf , and the theoretical models of alexander _ et al . \n _  ( 1996 ) and dantona & mazzitelli ( 1996 ) now support this interpretation for all metallicities . \n a test of this hypothesis is whether these ml relations , when applied to our cluster lfs , yield smooth mfs . \n when we apply either the observed solar metallicity ml relation of henry & mccarthy ( 1993 ) or the theoretical ml relation of alexander _ et al . _ \n ( 1996 ) to our lfs , we do indeed find mfs which rise smoothly through the peak and to the completeness limit of the data . \n this statement can not be made strongly , however , due to the small number of stars in our lfs . \n we note that our measured mfs rise as n @xmath35 m@xmath36 for both clusters , but that this value for the slope should not be taken too seriously , for the reasons mentioned above with regard to the insensitivity of this procedure to the mf slope , and because of its great dependence on the slope of the ml relation . \n in fact , dantona & mazzitelli ( 1996 ) demonstrate that a change in the imf slope moves the peak of the lf to a different mass value , by approximately 1 magnitude in the i - band for a change of 0.5 in the mf slope , depending somewhat on metallicity . \n the lf peak is thus a sensitive measure of the mf slope , and any significant changes in this slope from cluster to cluster would have destroyed the match between the data and the single mass locus seen in figure 5 . \n the increase in the slope of the ml relation below m@xmath34 @xmath2 9.5 makes a smooth mass function a viable explanation for these cluster lfs . \n it is therefore unnecessary to invoke the third possibility , a mf kink at @xmath30 m@xmath1 , as the cause of the lf turn - overs . \n such a mf kink is still possible , since the mf is very poorly determined at lower masses , but it is not _ \n necessary_.    a complication we have not addressed here is the effect on the actual mf of undiscovered binaries . \n a large number of stars with masses below @xmath30 m@xmath1 could be hiding as unseen companions of brighter main sequence stars . \n furthermore , globular clusters , open clusters , and the solar neighborhood field could have different relative numbers of such low mass companions . \n a detailed analysis of the effect of binarism on luminosity functions was presented by kroupa _ \n et al . _  ( 1993 ) to which the reader is referred . \n we conclude that the low mass imf is , to first order , independent of metallicity , with all the systematic changes in luminosity functions with metallicity dominated by the systematic changes in the mass - luminosity relation with metallicity . \n the implication for star formation is that a large range of initial conditions and environments produce essentially the same distribution by mass of low mass stars . \n additionally , the low mass mf is not steep enough to provide a large number of essentially invisible main sequence stars ( kroupa _ et al . _ \n using hst and the wfpc2 we have acquired very deep v- and i - band photometry of stars in ngc 2420 and ngc 2477 to study cluster luminosity functions at approximately solar metallicity . \n we have determined these cluster luminosity functions down to @xmath0 = 10.5 ( 0.2 m@xmath1 ) and find that the lf of ngc 2420 turns over at @xmath0 @xmath2 9.0 , and possibly stops altogether by @xmath0 @xmath2 9.5 . \n the lf of ngc 2477 may flatten at @xmath0 @xmath3 9.5 . \n we compare our open cluster luminosity functions to the solar neighborhood field star luminosity function of kroupa _ et al . _  ( 1993 ) and the four published hst globular cluster luminosity functions : @xmath4 cen ( elson _ et al . _ \n 1995 ) , 47 tuc ( de marchi & paresce 1995b ) , m 15 ( de marchi & paresce 1995a ) , and ngc 6397 ( paresce , de marchi & romaniello 1995 ) . \n we find a smooth relation between the location of the luminosity function turn -

orbit optical performance of the mrs as measured during cryogenic testing , and with a description of the procedure used to construct calibrated spectral data cubes from the raw measured images . \n the impact of particular characteristics of the mrs , including spectral fringing and straylight are also discussed here . \n an ifu based design was preferred to a long - slit design for the miri spectrometer for the following reasons . \n firstly , for point source observations , the need to centre the source in a narrow slit ( via a peak - up procedure ) is relaxed , simplifying and accelerating the target acquisition procedure . \n there is an additional benefit that there is no loss of light at the slices ( ` slit losses ' in a conventional long slit spectrometer ) . \n the mrs slice width is set to be less than or equal to the fwhm of the diffraction limited point spread function at the slicing mirror . \n an equivalent long - slit spectrometer would vignette the light outside this region , losing about 50% of the total . \n the amount of lost light could be reduced by making the slit wider , but doing so would in turn reduce the spatial and spectral resolution and could also decrease the signal to noise because of increased background radiation . \n second , from a scientific perspective , the wavelength range covered by the miri spectrometer is sufficiently broad ( a factor of nearly six ) that different emission mechanisms may dominate in different regions of the spectrum . in cases where these mechanisms do not share a common centre ( e.g. , stellar output compared with infrared re - emission in a starburst galaxy ) , a simple slit spectrograph poses a dilemma in placing the `` source '' on the slit . an ifu implements 3d spectroscopy , which solves this problem by giving accurately registered spatially resolved spectroscopy over the entire field . \n these considerations , combined with the wavelength coverage and resolving power requirements defined by the jwst mission science goals , and the mass , volume and electrical power limitations set by the jwst spacecraft environment , have resulted in a system with the characteristics summarised below and illustrated in block diagram form in figure 1 . \n as shown in the figure , the full 5 to 28.5 @xmath0 m wavelength range is divided within the spectrometer pre - optics ( spo ) into four simultaneous spectral channels @xcite , each with its own ifu @xcite and using a simple scheme of pass - band separation by dichroic filters whose design is described in hawkins et al . \n ( 2007 ) and wells et al . \n we denote the short and long wavelength limits of each channel as @xmath1 and @xmath2 . \n each channel serves an optimised spectrometer . \n this separation provides several benefits : ( 1 ) it enables the use of diffraction gratings in first order , allowing each to be used near peak efficiency around the blaze wavelength , and ( 2 ) it also allows the ifu slice widths to be tailored to the wavelength - scaled fwhm in each channel . \n electrical and thermal constraints limit the mrs to two 1024 x 1024 si : as detectors ( ressler et al . , 2014 , hereafter paper viii ) , resulting in the spectrometer being split into two sets of optics , each with its own detector array , one for the two short - wave channels and one for the two long - wave channels . in each case \n , the spectra of two wavelength channels are imaged simultaneously onto the left and right halves of a detector array . \n the product of spatial and spectral coverage that can be achieved in a single instantaneous exposure is ultimately set by the number of detector pixels . for the mrs , \n this results in a single exposure providing a spectral sub - band that covers only one third of each channel . \n full wavelength coverage then requires three exposures , with a pair of mechanisms being used to select the gratings and dichroics in each case . \n we refer to the short and long wavelength limits of each sub - band as @xmath3 and @xmath4 . \n this design choice allows the grating performance to be optimised over a narrow wavelength range ( @xmath4/@xmath5 @xmath61.2 ) . \n the gratings only have to work over 20% of the 1@xmath7 order near the blaze wavelength and the dichroics do not have to be used near the cross over between reflection and transmission . \n we will now step through the optical train as shown in figure 1 : the input optics and calibration ( ioc ) modules pick off the mrs fov from the jwst focal surface and pass it on to the spo . \n the spo spectrally splits the light into the 4 spectrometer channels and spatially reformats the rectangular fields of view into slits at the entrance of the spectrometer main optics ( smo ) . \n the smo comprises fixed optics that collimate the light for presentation to diffraction gratings mounted in the spo and then re - images the dispersed spectra onto the two focal plane arrays . \n key features of this optical system are described individually in the following subsections . \n the spectral and spatial coverage of the mrs is summarised in table 1 .      the field of view of the mrs is adjacent to the miri imager field and picked off from the jwst focal surface using the miri pickoff mirror ( pom ) , which is common to both ( see paper ii ) . \n the sky and the jwst pupil are reimaged by the ioc so that there is a pupil image at the spo input and a sky image further on . \n a cold stop that is 5% oversized with respect to the jwst pupil is placed at the spo input pupil for straylight control . \n the light is directed towards the first dichroic filter via a fold mirror placed 10 mm beyond the pupil . \n the focal plane is formed 535 mm beyond the pupil , providing the long path length and narrow beam waist needed between the pupil and the inputs of the four integral field units ( ifus ) , for mounting a chain of dichroics to divide the light among the four spectral channels .    a hole in the fold mirror , sized to be smaller than the footprint of the telescope central obscuration , acts as an aperture for the injection of light from the on - board spectrometer calibration unit ( scu ) , shown in figure 2 . \n the scu provides spatially and spectrally uniform blackbody illumination for flux calibration and pixel flat fielding functions , using as its light source a tungsten filament heated to a temperature of @xmath61000 k by the application of an 8 ma drive current . \n the filament is mounted inside a non - imaging flux concentrator that generates spatially uniform focal plane illumination at the exit port of a 25 mm diameter reflective hemisphere , ( described in glasse et al . , 2006 ) . \n two cadmium telluride lenses within the scu then re - image the exit port onto the ifu input focal planes . the lenses provide a pupil image that coincides with the hole in the input fold mirror . \n this hole is positioned to lie within the footprint of the central obscuration of the jwst primary mirror and so has no impact on the science beam . in this way \n , the scu can provide flood illumination of the full mrs field of view without any need for mechanisms or additional optical elements . \n the overall layout of the dichroic assembly is shown in figure 3 , with the input fold mirror and scu situated at the left - hand end ( but not shown ) . \n the three dichroics needed to divide the spectral band among the four spectrometer channels for one of the three sub - bands are indicated as d1 , d2 , and d3 in figures 1 and 3 . taking sub - band a as an example , the required reflective band for dichroic d1 is the wavelength range for sub - band a in channel 1 , while its transmission band needs to extend from the short end of sub - band a in channel 2 to the long end of sub - band a in channel 4 . \n the bands are listed in table 2 for all nine dichroics . in all cases , the mean \n reflectivity is above 0.95 and the mean transmission is above 0.74 . \n all of the gratings work in first diffractive order so additional blocking is needed to reject second and higher orders . because the dichroics work in series it is possible to use the combined blocking of dichroics 1 and 2 to remove the need for blocking filters in channels 3 and 4 . for channels 1 and 2 , \n dedicated blocking is provided by the fixed filters shown as bf1 and bf2 in figure 3 , with light traps lt1 and lt2 absorbing unwanted reflections .    the path length required to reach the input of channel 4 is greater than the 535 mm discussed above , so the light transmitted by the final dichroic is re - imaged via an intermediate focal plane to the entrance of the channel 4 ifu . \n the 21 mm diameter dichroic filters are mounted on two wheels . \n first is the nine - sided wheel a containing the three channel 1 dichroic filters and three flat mirrors to direct the light towards channel 1 . the second , six - sided wheel , contains the six dichroics needed to divert the light into channels 2 and 3 . \n each dichroic filter is mounted onto a diamond machined facet on the wheel that provides the required alignment accuracy and reduces the magnitude of any print - through of surface form errors from the wheel to the filter substrate . \n the filters are held in place with a spring loaded bezel with a clear aperture of 17 mm compared with the coated area of 17.4 mm . \n the bezel prevents light from reaching the uncoated area of the filter , which might result in un - filtered light entering the optical path . \n the blocking filters are mounted directly to the spo chassis with a stand and bezel , similar to the mounting arrangement for the wheels . \n the mechanisms that carry the dichroic wheels also carry the corresponding wheels with diffraction gratings for each sub - band ( three per channel ) , as discussed in section 2.4 . by arranging for the gratings to be mounted on the same mechanisms as their band - selecting dichroics , \n the number of moving mechanisms within the mrs is kept to two .      before the light in the four channels reaches the gratings it is sliced and reformatted by the integral field units and \n so we describe these next . \n the parameters pertaining to the spatial and spectral coverage and sampling of the spectrometer , which are largely determined by the design of the four ifus , are given in table 1 . \n spatially , the image is sampled in the dispersion direction by the ifu slicing mirrors and in the slice direction by the detector pixels . \n spectrally , the width of the slices defines the spectrometer entrance slit and the width of the image ( in pixels ) of the slice at the detector defines the width of the spectral sample . \n inspection of table 1 then shows that channels 1 to 3 are all slightly undersampled spectrally , with slice widths less than 2 pixels at the detector . \n the bandwidths of the spectral channels listed in table 1 were chosen such that the ratio @xmath8/@xmath1 in all four channels was the same : @xmath2/@xmath9 ( 28.3 / 5)@xmath10 1.54 . \n this means that , if each channel is assigned the same number of spectral pixels , the resolving power in each will be approximately the same . \n each sub - band then has a width that is slightly larger than one third of the band - width of its parent channel , where the excess provides sufficient overlap of adjacent spectra to allow their concatenation . in practice , the overlap is typically 10 to 15% of the spectral range , depending on the specific sub - bands and position in the field of view .    for full nyquist sampling of the telescope \n psf the four ifu slice widths should ideally be matched to the half width at half maximum intensity of the psf at the shortest wavelength in each channel . \n for the jwst telescope pupil this would equate to a@xmath11 0.088 ( @xmath12 / 5 @xmath0 m ) arcsec . \n however , the large increase in the beam size produced by diffraction at the ifu slicer mirror would then necessitate large apertures for the spectrometer optics to avoid vignetting . to control the size , mass and optical aberrations of the spectrometer , the starting point for determining the slice widths was therefore to set them equal to 2a@xmath13 , with fully sampled psfs to be achieved using two or more pointings of the telescope . \n optimum spatial sampling , which minimises the number of telescope pointings needed to fully sample all four channels simultaneously in the across - slice direction , is achieved by having a single pointing offset equal to n@xmath14 + 1/2 slice widths for all channels where n@xmath14 is a different integer for each channel . \n this led us to adopt a set of slice widths that follow a scheme where the slices are factors of 1 , 11/7 , 11/5 and 11/3 wider than the narrowest 0.176 arcsec slice . \n these values closely match the increasing fwhm of the psf in the 4 channels and allow full nyquist sampling to be achieved using a single ` diagonal ' offset whose magnitude in the across slice direction is equal to 11/2 times the width of the narrowest slice ( 0.97 arcseconds ) and ( n + 1/2 ) detector pixels in the along slice direction ( where n is an integer ) . with \n these slice widths fixed the design was interated to , as far as possible , meet the following criteria : 1 . ) \n each channel would occupy half a 1024 x 1024 pixel detector with borders to allow for tolerances in alignment and gaps between slices to avoid crosstalk ; 2 . ) \n the fov of each channel should be as large as possible and approximately square ; and 3 . ) \n the long and short wavelength arms of the spectrometer should be identical ( in practice one is the mirror image of the other ) . \n this iteration resulted in the parameters in table 1 . \n the ifu design was developed from the ifu deployed in uist , a 1 - 5 @xmath0 m spectrometer for ukirt @xcite . \n other examples of all - reflecting image slicers are the spectrometer for infrared faintfield imaging ( spiffi ) @xcite , and the slicer in the gemini near - infrared spectrograph ( gnirs ) @xcite . \n the miri ( and uist ) ifu design allows excellent control over stray light by providing through - apertures for baffling . \n it consists of an entrance pupil , an input fold mirror , an image slicer mirror , a mask carrying exit pupils for the individual sliced images , a mask carrying slitlets for the individual images , and an array of re - imaging mirrors behind the slitlets . these components ( except for the last ) are shown in figure 4 . \n the design is all - reflecting and constructed entirely of aluminium , and hence is well - suited for operation in the infrared and at cryogenic temperatures , as discussed in paper ii . \n @xcite describe the manufacture of the slicer . \n the optical path through the ifus begins with the four toroidal mirrors , which comprise the anamorphic pre - optics ( apo ) module , ( not shown in figure 4 ) . \n the apo re - images an area of up to 8 by 8 arcseconds of the input focal plane onto the image slicer mirror , with anamorphic magnification . \n the image slicer ( at the relayed image plane ) consists of a stack of thin mirrors angled to divide the image along the dispersion direction of the spectrometer into separate beams . in the across slice ( dispersion ) direction one slice width \n is matched to the fwhm of the airy pattern at the shortest operating wavelength for the ifu . in the along slice direction \n the magnification is chosen to provide the required plate scale at the detector . \n these two magnifications are not the same and so the apo exit pupil is elliptical , as illustrated in figure 5 for channel 3 , where the footprint of the jwst pupil is shown in blue . \n the light exits the ifu through individual pupil masks for each beam , then through individual slitlets ( see figure 4 ) . \n re - imaging mirrors behind the slitlets relay the beam to the input of the appropriate spectrometer . \n that is , each ifu takes the rectangular fov and transforms it into a pattern of slitlets ( as shown in figure 4 ) that are re - imaged onto the entrance aperture for its corresponding grating spectrometer . \n the slicing mirror comprises a number of spherical optical surfaces , diamond turned onto a common substrate . \n this manufacturing approach was used previously for the ifu in gnirs @xcite . \n figure 6 is a photograph of the image slicer for channel 1 , which has 21 slicer mirrors arranged about the centre of the component with 11 slices on one side and 10 on the other . \n each mirror is offset to direct its output beam towards the corresponding re - imaging mirror . \n the design for channels 2 to 4 is similar but with correspondingly fewer and larger slices as the wavelength increases , as listed in table 1 . \n the mirrors are arranged in a staircase - like manner to aid manufacturing . \n each of the slices re - images the ifu entrance pupil at a scale of @xmath151:1 and because the centres of curvature of the mirrors are offset laterally with respect to each other , the pupils that the slices produce are separated , as can be seen in figure 4 . \n the slicing mirrors truncate the anamorphically magnified image of the sky along the dispersion direction , as shown in figure 7 ( a ) to ( c ) . \n this truncation results in the pupil image being diffraction broadened in the dispersion direction as shown in figure 7 ( d ) . to reduce vignetting , the baffle at this pupil image and subsequent optical components ( including the diffraction gratings ) \n are oversized . \n this is illustrated in figure 7(d ) where the geometric footprints for 3 field positions are overlaid along a slice to appear as the blurred green patch in the image . \n the notional , geometric pupil is shown in red and the oversized mask aperture is shown as a green rectangle . \n the re - imaging mirror array forms images of the slicing mirrors as input slits of the spectrometer and also images the pupils at infinity , making the output telecentric . \n finally , a roof mirror redirects light from the re - imaging mirrors so that the output consists of the two lines of staggered slitlets relayed from those seen in figure 4 . \n a slotted mask at the position of the ifu output slits defines the field of view along the individual slices , while in the spectral direction the slots are oversized to ensure they do not vignette the image , but still act as baffles to reduce scattered light between the slices . \n the numbers of detector columns covered by the four ifus are approximately 476 , 464 , 485 , 434 for channels 1 to 4 respectively . \n the size of the gap between individual slits for channel 1 is set to be approximately equal to the diameter of the first dark diffraction ring in the telescope psf , ( about 4 pixels ) . for channels 2 \n 4 the size of the gap is slightly greater than the diameter of the first dark ring . \n the smo ( whose layout is shown in figure 8) , comprises four grating spectrometers in two arms . \n the development and test of these spectrometers are described by @xcite . \n each of them performs three functions : collimation of the telecentric output beams of one of the four ifus , dispersion of the collimated beam , and imaging of the resulting spectrum onto one half of one of the two focal plane arrays . \n one of the two spectrometer arms includes the two short wavelength channels ( 1 and 2 ) , and the other the long wavelength channels ( 3 and 4 ) . \n we will now step through the optical path from the ifus to the detectors . \n the ifu output beam for each channel is collimated and its light directed towards the corresponding diffraction gratings as shown in figure 9 . \n each spectrometer arm uses 6 gratings ( two wavelength channels , three sub - band exposures ) . \n figure 8 then shows the optical paths from the gratings to the detectors . \n the dispersed beams are imaged by three - mirror - anastigmat ( tma ) camera systems ( m1-m2-m3 ) . in each spectrometer arm \n the channels have separate , but identical , m1 camera mirrors that provide intermediate images of the spectra between m1 and m2 . \n folding flats at these intermediate focus positions reflect the channel 1 and channel 4 beams such that the combined ( ch . \n 1 + 2 ) and ( ch . 3 + 4 ) beam pairs are imaged onto opposite halves of the detectors by common m2 and m3 mirrors . \n the symmetry through the centre plane of the camera optics and the positioning of the optics allow for an opto - mechanical design of two mirror - imaged boxes , with identical optics and almost identical structures . \n the combination of symmetry and an all aluminium design ( optics as well as structures ) allowed the very strict alignment and stability requirements to be met fully with an adjustment - free mounting ( i.e. positional accuracy by manufacturing accuracy only except for the focus shim at the detector interface ) , a major advantage regarding the total design , manufacture and test effort . \n the mirror substrates are all light - weighted aluminium with diamond turned optical surfaces that are gold coated for maximum reflectivity at the miri operating wavelengths . \n they are mounted through holes in the housing walls using stress - relieving lugs under light - tight covers to prevent any high temperature radiation from the instrument enclosure ( at @xmath640 k ) reaching the detectors . \n the two sets of gratings for the a , b and c sub - bands of the two channels are mounted on a single wheel , as shown in figure 10 , that is mounted on a mechanism that also carries the dichroics wheel on a lower level . \n the mechanisms are located in the spo and each mechanism is rotated by a single actuator to give the correct combination of dichroics and gratings across all channels for each exposure . the gratings are master rulings on aluminium substrates and are gold coated . \n table 3 lists the design parameters of the gratings . \n all gratings operate in first order . \n the angular values quoted in figure 1 are calculated for the ( virtual ) nominal input beam , originating from the centre of the ifu output area . \n the spo is designed to be a well baffled optical system . to intercept stray light from the telescope \n the first optical element in the mrs is a cold stop placed at the entrance pupil . \n a number of features within the mrs help to control stray light : 1 . ) stops at each pupil and sky image in the optical train ; 2 . ) \n light traps where significant stray light occurs ( 0@xmath16 order from the gratings ) ; 3 . ) \n labyrinths at the edges of apertures between modules and tight control of all external apertures , e.g. electrical feed throughs ; 4 . ) \n black coating of all surfaces not in the main optical path , which is an inorganic black anodising applied to a roughened surface of aluminium . \n the process was carried out by protection des metaux , paris ; and 5 . ) \n avoidance of surfaces at grazing incidence near the main optical path . \n in addition , for each slice of each ifu there are output pupil and slit masks . \n all the diamond turned aluminium mirrors in miri were specified to have a surface roughness of < 10 nm rms . \n this results in a total integrated scatter per surface of < 0.06% ; non - sequential optical modelling indicated that this level of scatter should not significantly degrade the psf of the mrs . \n all mirrors have an overcoated gold surface with reflectivity > 98.5% in the miri wavelength range . \n straylight analysis shows that the extensive baffling combined with the low scattering optical surfaces and blackened structure should reduce unwanted light ( cross talk between channels , degraded psf and out - of - beam light at the output image ) to levels that are estimated to be less than 0.1% of the background radiation included in the science beam . \n due to the nature of an ifu spectrograph with its slicing and dispersing optics , the resulting detector images are not straightforward to analyze : spatial , spectral , and with it photometric information , are spread over the entire detector array . \n further , the gratings are used in an optically fast , non - littrow conguration . \n the resulting anamorphic magnification varies from the short to long wavelength limit for each sub - band which , when combined with the curved spectral images of the dispersed slices on the detector as shown in figure 11 , makes the optical distortion significant and complex . \n the anamorphic and slicing optics add other components of distortion that vary the plate scale in the along - slice direction for each slice individually . \n this leads to a very complicated variation of the spatial plate scales and finally to a dependency of the spatial and spectral axes on each other and on the location on the detector array .    to enable scientific studies \n based on mrs data , the flux measured in each detector pixel needs to be associated with a wavelength and location on the sky . \n since the ifu provides two spatial dimensions , each detector pixel corresponds to a position within a three - dimensional cube with two spatial and one spectral dimension . \n due to the optical distortion , the edges of these cubes are neither orthogonal nor constant in length . \n consequently , we have developed a process ( called image or cube reconstruction ) , which allows a transformation of the detector pixels onto orthogonal cubes . \n cube reconstruction requires a thorough understanding of the optical distortion . \n it is not possible to just characterize the curved images of the dispersed slices ( as shown in the left plot of figure 11 ) by approximating the curvature with polynomial functions . due to the distortion caused by the slicing optics , the spatial plate scale varies within a slice non - uniformly . \n the characterization of the plate scale and the association of each detector pixel with its projected location on the sky at any given wavelength is a task for the astrometric and wavelength calibration , described in the next sections . \n once the sky - coordinates and wavelength are known for each detector pixel , the cube can be reconstructed as discussed by glauser et . \n 2010 ) .      to describe the optical distortion on the image plane of the detectors we began from the optical model , using ray - tracing techniques to project each detector pixel through the slicing optics backwards onto the sky . \n when the as - built geometry was taken into account , we achieved a high spatial accuracy , as demonstrated for the miri verification model ( glauser , et al . , 2010 ) . \n to verify this approach , a dedicated astrometric calibration campaign was conducted during the instrument test campaign of the miri flight model .    as outlined in glauser et al . \n ( 2010 ) , the intra - slice spatial distortion can be approximated with a 2@xmath17 order polynomial to accuracies of a few milli - arcseconds - much better than required for the astrometric accuracy given the minimum plate scale of 0.196 arcseconds in the along - slice direction for channel 1 . \n we conducted the astrometric calibration by placing a broad - band point source at three field positions for each slice and each channel and recording the dispersed signature on the detector . \n the central pixel of the spatial profile was determined and correlated with the known position of the point source ( our reference on the sky ) . with this method \n we were able to determine the spatial plate scale at any location on the detector . due to limitations of the test setup , i.e. , strong field distortion of the steerable point - source , \n the achievable relative astrometric accuracy was very limited . \n however , within an estimated upper limit of @xmath60.5 pixels ( 0.098  arcsecond for channels 1 and 2 , 0.123  arcsecond for channel 3 , and 0.137  arcsecond for channel 4 ) , the approach of using the optical model for the reconstruction was validated . \n a further result from this calibration campaign was the measurement of the fov for each sub - band . \n figure 12 shows the mrs fov in the jwst coordinate frame and its position relative to the imager field . \n the fov common to all mrs channels is 3.64  arcsec in the along - slice ( @xmath18 and 3.44  arcsec in the across - slice direction ( @xmath19 .      to determine the absolute wavelengths for the mrs channels we conducted a series of calibration measurements during the instrument test campaign . \n fabry - prot etalon filters were used to create a dense pattern of unresolved spectral lines on the detector . \n many tens of lines were typically visible at a signal to noise ratio of more than 50 in a single sub - band exposure . \n an example etalon measurement is shown in figure 13 . to provide a reference wavelength to distinguish between adjacent etalon lines , the telescope simulator used in the test \n was also equipped with a pair of ` edge ' filters , one of which cut - on at around @xmath20 6.6 @xmath0 m ( in sub - band 1c ) and the other which cut off at @xmath21 21.5 @xmath0 m ( in sub - band 4b ) . \n the absolute wavelengths of the etalon lines and edge filters had previously been measured at ambient and 77 k temperatures using a laboratory standard fourier transform spectrometer with a spectral resolving power of r @xmath22 100,000 . \n the extrapolation of the wavelength scale to the 34 k operating temperature for the test campaign was based on published measurements ( browder and ballard , 1969 , browder and ballard , 1972 and smith and white , 1975 ) . \n this extrapolation resulted in a typical wavelength correction of less than 1% of the width of the mrs spectral resolution element . \n the repeatability of the scale after multiple mechanism reconfigurations has been measured to be 0.02 resolution elements . \n the wavelength calibration process then involved the assignment of an absolute wavelength to an etalon line by fitting the calibrated spectra of the edge filters to their mrs measured spectra in sub - band 1c and 4b . \n the known separation of the etalon lines was used to extend the wavelength scale across the full spectral image in each of these sub - bands . to extend the scale to other sub - bands , pairs of measured etalon spectra \n were co - added and the positions of unique identifying features ( due to spectral beating between the two patterns ) were used . \n a set ( 2 per sub - band ) of second order polynomial fits to the positions of the etalon lines was used to generate a wavelength value for the corners of all illuminated pixels . \n the wavelength calibration derived in this way was encoded for use in the mrs calibration pipeline by forming six images ( one for each mrs detector and all three grating wheel settings ) where the image signal values were set equal to the wavelengths at the corner of each detector pixel . \n we note that as a result , these wavelength reference images have one more row and column than the detector images . \n the relative accuracy of this wavelength scale ( within and between sub - bands ) is estimated to be better than 0.02 spectral resolution elements which , for example , corresponds to 0.03 nm at @xmath21 5 @xmath0 m . \n the absolute accuracy of the wavelength scale is estimated to be comparable to this figure but this will need to be confirmed during on - orbit commissioning using spectral standards . \n the wavelength calibrated etalon spectra were also used to measure the spectral resolving power of the mrs . \n the results are shown in figure 14 , where the sub - band averaged values are shown in red and the spread of values seen across the field of view is indicated by the black band . \n we note that figure 14 does not take account of the intrinsic spectral width of the etalon features , which was determined using the r @xmath22 100,000 calibrated spectra , described above . \n initial efforts to deconvolve the intrinsic line profiles from the mrs measured spectra suggest that the resolving powers quoted in figure 14 may be underestimated by around 10 % . \n we have therefore used the band averaged measurements scaled by a factor 1.1 to generate the summary values quoted in table 1 .      as outlined in section [ sec : optical ] , the psf of the mrs is under - sampled by design , with full sampling in both spatial and spectral dimensions requiring that the object be observed in at least two dither positions that include an offset in the across - slice direction of 11/2 times the channel 1 slice width ( which corresponds to 7/2 slices in channel 2 , 5/2 slices in channel 3 , and 3/2 slices in channel 4 ) . due to the curved shape of the distorted spectrum on the detector and the variable plate scale along the individual slices , \n the exact dither offset in the along - slice direction is less well determined ( but also less critical ) . \n figure 15 shows the nominal mrs dither pattern to be used in a single observation to sample point sources fully , as derived during test campaigns , and as proposed for in - flight operations .    to achieve a fully sampled psf \n , these dithered observations must be combined . \n we anticipate that this could most readily be achieved using the reconstructed cubes . \n to avoid loss of spatial resolving power caused by any shift- and co - adding algorithm due to the re - binning of the data ( for example , fruchter & hook , 2002 ) , we minimize the necessary re - binning steps by incorporating dither offsets parallel to the slice into the reconstruction algorithm itself . \n this has the advantage that only one re - binning step is required from detector data to reconstructed cubes , while dither offsets in the across slice direction can be corrected and combined afterwards using an interlacing method . \n we expect more sophisticated techniques than we have developed so far to be incorporated into the data reduction pipeline before launch . \n we attempted to measure the mrs psf during flight model testing at ral using the miri telescope simulator ( mts ) , described in paper ii . \n however , optical aberrations and vignetting in the mts led to the generated point source being elongated and extended at short wavelengths , such that it did not provide a sufficiently point - like image . even at longer wavelengths , where aberrations became less apparent as diffraction started to dominate , \n the measured psf was broader than nominal due to vignetting in the telescope simulator . \n we therefore repeated the psf measurement on the flight model during the first cryo - vacuum test campaign at nasa - goddard ( cv1rr ) , where a compact and well defined point source was available . \n deep exposures at 17 different locations in the mrs field were combined and reconstructed to form the psf image for channel 1a , shown in figure 16 . for these data , \n the spectral coverage was limited to a narrow ( 0.125 @xmath0 m wide ) wavelength range around 5.6  @xmath0 m . \n a comparison with the model psf ( pure diffraction limited fourier - transformed jwst pupil ) shows a very good match across the slices . in the along - slice direction , a broadening of approximately 50% \n is observed . \n currently , possible causes considered for the broadening include scattering in the detector substrate ( the detector halo effect , which is also observed in the imager and is discussed in rieke et al . , ( 2014 , paper vii ) or a side - effect of the straylight discussed in section [ subsec : mylabel6 ] . in the case of the halo effect , \n the larger degree of broadening seen in the mrs may be due to the larger spatial sample per pixel . \n more detailed modelling is required to confirm the root cause . \n spectral fringes are a common characteristic of infrared spectrometers . they originate from interference at plane - parallel surfaces in the light path of the instrument . \n these surfaces act as fabry - prot etalons , each of which can absorb light from the source signal with a unique fringe pattern . in the infrared wavelength range , surfaces separated by a fraction of a mm up to a few cm may form very efficient etalons . the most obvious source of fringes in the mrs is the detector itself with a physical thickness of 500 @xmath0 m ( paper vii ) . \n similar fringes have also been observed in spectra measured with the miri verification model during testing and with the spitzer - irs instrument , which employs comparable ( though smaller ) si : as bib detectors , lahuis & boogert ( 2003 ) .    for the initial analysis we follow the formalism \n as defined in kester et al . , ( 2003 ) and lahuis & boogert , ( 2003 ) . \n the sine approximation , @xmath23 _ _ cos(2__@xmath24 _ _ sin(2__@xmath25 , is used with @xmath26 being the wavenumber and @xmath27 the optical thickness of the instrument component . \n of primary interest to help in the identification and first characterization of the fringes is the optical thickness @xmath27 . in the mrs test data three distinct fringe components \n are seen , with key parameters listed in table 4 .    of the three fringe components two \n are directly matched to optical components in the instrument . \n the main fringe component ( # 1 in table 4 ) has a derived optical thickness of approximately 3.5 mm for all sub - bands . \n this corresponds to the optical thickness of the detector substrate which has d @xmath6 500 @xmath28 m and n @xmath6 3.42 , giving d @xmath6 0.34 cm . \n figure 17 gives an illustration of this fringe pattern , showing the main detector and dichroic fringes in more detail for channel 4 . \n the optical thickness derived for the second , high frequency , component ( d @xmath6 2.7 cm ) is matched to that of the cdte dichroic filters ( section 2.2 ) . for the third set of low frequency components ( d = 0.01 to 0.1 cm ) , \n no unique surfaces in the instrument are identified ; instead these are likely to originate from beating between primary fringe components . \n the fringe variations come from the layered structure of the detector substrate and optical thickness differences between individual dichroic filters . \n figure 18 shows the peak normalized fringes over the entire wavelength range of the mrs . \n the two curves in figure 18 show predictions for the expected fringe amplitudes based on representative anti - reflection ( ar ) coating profiles as applied to the miri flight detectors . \n the solid curve assumes a pure two - sided etalon while the dashed - dotted curve simulates a back - illuminated surface with a fully reflective front surface and photon absorption in the active layer ( adopted from woods et al . , 2011 ) . \n though not a perfect match , this approximate detector model does reproduce the general trend and magnitude of the fringes . \n fringe removal will be achieved using the techniques developed for and applied to iso and spitzer data ( see lahuis & van dishoeck , 2000 ; kester et al . , 2003 ; lahuis & boogert , 2003 ) . \n this involves dividing the observed spectra by a fringe flat - field followed by the removal of fringe residuals using the sine fitting method . \n this approach has proven to be reliable and robust for most spectra and the experience with iso and spitzer has shown that it allows the removal of fringe residuals down to the noise level . \n the main limitations with this technique are the definition of the spectral continuum in the presence of spectral features and isolating the fringe spectrum from broad molecular ( vibration-)rotation bands ( e.g. those of c@xmath29h@xmath29 , hcn , co@xmath29 and h@xmath29o ) .    for the miri ifu \n other effects play a role and may limit the fringe removal for point and compact source measurements . \n the two major effects are ; i ) the illumination ( and its effective angle ) on the detector depends on the source morphology ( position and extent ) and ii ) the wavelength depends on the spatial location of the point source in the ifu field . \n this results in i ) changes in the effective optical thickness from source to source and ii ) a wavelength shift with spatial offset . \n both modify the detailed fringe pattern for individual cases . \n figure 19 illustrates this with point source measurements from the cv1rr test campaign and using extended source blackbody spectra from flight model testing at ral . \n small sub - pixel pointing offsets are seen to have a discernable impact on the fringe pattern . \n these effects can be mitigated by traditional fringe removal techniques using optimized and iterative reduction algorithms ( e.g. by modifying , shifting and stretching the reference fringe spectrum before applying it ) . \n this has been used in individual iso and spitzer cases and the miri team will work on developing optimized methods for the mrs . for miri \n an alternative model - based approach is also under study which uses the observed source morphology to define the fringe spectrum . \n this method will be applicable to both the mrs and the lrs , and will complement the traditional fringe removal techniques . \n this requires both a well - defined and well - calibrated fringe model ( an ongoing miri team activity ) and a flexible and iterative reduction pipeline ( in development at stsci based on input from the miri team ) . \n we determined the pixel - to - pixel variation of the response for both short and long wavelength detectors , using measurements taken during testing at ral . \n the illumination was provided by an external , extended source in the mts . \n a number of exposures measured over the period of the whole test run and covering the full mrs wavelength range were included in this calculation . \n we first de - fringed the data using the prescription described in section [ subsec : spectral ] , with the results illustrated in figure 17 . \n we then calculated the mean value of each pixel , @xmath30 , by averaging over 5 x 5 pixel boxes centered on pixel ( @xmath31 and accounting for pixels close to the edges of the slices or near bad pixel clusters . \n the original data were then divided by these averaged values to create a map of the normalized pixel gain . \n we checked the distribution of the pixel - to - pixel variation for each exposure in all the available data for both detectors and all the sub - bands and found that the distribution is gaussian with a full - width - half - maximum of @xmath62% ( figure 20 ) . \n the variation among different datasets has a standard deviation of @xmath32 0.2% for 16 different observations . \n the pixel - to - pixel variation does not appear to be wavelength dependent as both short and long wavelength detectors show the same overall flatness . \n this uniformity suggests that the correction of pixel response variations on orbit can be achieved using infrequent calibration measurements . \n the absolute responsivity of the mrs is expressed in terms of the quantity referred to as the photon conversion efficiency ( pce ) , which is equal to the number of electrons detected by the focal plane array for each photon incident at the miri entrance focal plane . \n the wavelength - dependent pces for the mrs were derived during testing at ral . \n this was done by configuring the mts to provide extended illumination of the miri entrance pupil with the spectral energy distributions of blackbodies of 400 , 600 and 800 kelvin . for each mts blackbody configuration , \n mrs spectra were obtained in all 12 spectral bands , together with background measurements using the blank position in the mts filter wheel . \n the data were processed using the standard dhas tool ( paper ii ) , which converts the raw readouts of the integration ramps to slopes in physical units ( electrons / sec ) . \n the dhas miricube module , which performs the reconstruction technique described in section [ subsec : mylabel4 ] , was then used to construct spectral cubes from the slope images , re - gridding the focal plane array pixel signals onto an equidistant spectral cube . \n the spectral cubes of the background measurements ( mts filter blank position ) were subtracted from the flood illumination measurements to correct for the test facility background . \n the spectral cubes produced with the dhas miricube routine have a fully calibrated wcs with the plate scale and wavelength coverage of every cube pixel . when combined with an estimate for the absolute flux delivered to the entrance focal plane by the mts ( paper ii ) , this allows us to calculate the photon conversion efficiency in every pixel of the spectral cube for all mrs spectral bands . \n table 5 lists the mean pces for all mrs bands . \n we estimate the fractional error to be 20 % in these figures , due to systematic effects , primarily in estimating the absolute flux from the mts . \n one obvious feature of table 5 is the sharp drop in pce from channel 3 to channel 4 . \n the pce in channel 4 is roughly a factor of 2.5 lower than was expected from sub - system measurements of the nominal mrs optical train . \n the extra loss was identified ( m. te plate , esa , private communication ) as being caused by a fault in the groove profiles of the channel 4 gratings , which can not be corrected before launch . \n following the procedure to determine the photon conversion efficiency , we can establish a first spectrophotometric calibration . by comparing the flux conversion factors derived from blackbody measurements of the mts at 400 , 600 and 800k \n , we can assess the achievable spectrophotometric calibration accuracy . \n figure 21 shows the ratios of the different obtained flux conversion factors as a function of wavelength . \n we are encouraged by the good agreement ( less than 2 % variation ) over a large swathe of the mrs wave - band .      as described in sections 2.3 and 2.5 , \n great care was taken to minimise sources of straylight and optical cross - talk within the mrs ifus . \n however , a source of straylight was detected during ral testing , which was identified as being caused by scattering in optical components within the smo . \n the stray light is manifested as a signal that extends in the detector row direction . \n its magnitude is proportional to that of bright illuminated regions of the spectral image , at a ratio that falls with increasing wavelength , from about 2 % in channel 1a to undetectably low levels longward of channel 2b . \n [ fig23 ] emphasises the impact of the straylight in channel 1b , using the wavelength - averaged , reconstructed image of a bright source ( seen at the top - left ) . \n the straylight signature is seen as the two horizontal bands , where the variation in brightness with the ` alpha ' coordinate is well explained by the mapping between alpha and detector row coordinate . \n the development of algorithms for correction of this straylight is underway . \n they take advantage of the stray - light being the dominant signal in the inter - slice regions of the detector , thereby making it amenable to accurate characterisation . \n initial indications ( figure 22 ) suggest that an effective correction algorithm will be available before launch . \n testing at ral revealed a gap in the performance of the train of dichroics described in section 2.2 . \n the set of filters that define the pass - band for channel 3 , sub - band a , have an unwanted ( but small ) transmission peak at a wavelength of 6.1 @xmath0 m , which allows light in the second diffraction order to reach the detector at the position where 12.2 @xmath0 m light is detected in the first diffraction order . \n this leak was confirmed using fabry - prot etalon data and characterised to produce the leak profile plotted in figure 23 . \n this curve can be interpreted as the transmission profile by which the 6.1 @xmath0 m spectrum of a target object should be multiplied to determine the leakage signal at 12.2 @xmath0 m . \n there are two options for mitigating the effects of the spectral leak . \n first , the channel 3a spectrum can be corrected by multiplying an observation of the 6.1 @xmath0 m ( channel 1b ) spectrum of the target object by the leak profile , resampling the wavelength scale of the resulting spectrum to the wavelength grid of channel 3a and then subtracting it from the contaminated channel 3a spectrum . \n this requires that a separate channel 1b observation has been taken . \n the second method would be to make the channel 3a observation with dichroic wheel 1 set to use the sub - band c dichroics ( see section 2.2 to see what this means in terms of the optical train ) . \n this combination of dichroics reduces the spectral leak by a factor of more than 1000 at @xmath33 = 6.1 @xmath28 m . \n the unwanted side - effect of this solution is up to a factor of three loss of pce at the short wavelength ends of channel 2a and channel 4a . \n we have presented the key parameters that describe the performance of the miri mrs spectrometer as designed or measured , in a form that both provides our best estimate of the behaviour of the instrument on - orbit and also that is accessible to the prospective user . \n the optical design behind the parameters is presented at a level of detail that is intended to provide the astronomer with an understanding of what to expect in terms of operating restrictions and data format when planning observations . \n the impact of straylight and spectral leaks in contaminating the spectral images has been discussed , along with proposals of operational and analytical techniques that should mitigate their effects . when combined with the latest sensitivity estimates ( glasse et al . , 2014 , paper ix ) , we are confident that the miri mrs will meet all of its scientific objectives as part of the jwst observatory . \n the work presented is the effort of the entire miri team and the enthusiasm within the miri partnership is a significant factor in its success . \n miri draws on the scientific and technical expertise many organizations , as summarized in papers i and ii . \n a portion of this work was carried out at the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under a contract with the national aeronautics and space administration . \n we would like to thank the following national and international funding agencies for their support of the miri development : nasa ; esa ; belgian science policy office ; centre nationale detudes spatiales ; danish national space centre ; deutsches zentrum fur luft -

The lifetime of ultra-heavy dark matter (UHDM) can be relatively short, and a small fraction of the mass of primary DDM particles can change to a scalar field with a proper self-interaction potential, leading to a quintessential matter that behaves like a gradual condensation of this field at late times. We study the plausibility of this model and show that it can fit the supernovae Ia data better than other quintessence models.

The model presented here can explain the coincidence problem and the smallness of the cosmological constant naturally, and it can also provide a source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

field time domain astronomy , where ground - based observations yield very precise measurements of stellar brightness from high - volume data streams . \n so far , wide - field time - series surveys has been spearheaded by relatively small telescopes since they are supported by large field of view ( fov ) instruments operating with high duty cycle ( see @xcite for a summary of optical variability surveys ) . within the last decade , \n the advent of large mosaic ccds has facilitated the coverage of large sky area even for large - aperture telescopes ( e.g. , mmt megacam : @xcite ; eso very large telescope omegacam : @xcite ; subaru suprime - cam : @xcite ; chft megacam : @xcite ; iptf : @xcite ) . \n although these facilities are generally devoted to imaging surveys , researchers are attempting to utilize them for short- and long - term variability surveys with short - cadence exposures ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n such wide - field imaging systems have enabled us to observe hundred of thousands of target stars simultaneously and also to detect various variability phenomena . \n a remarkable thing about these surveys is that the fraction of variable sources increases as the photometric precision of the survey improves . \n for this reason , it is important to improve the accuracy in photometry . \n another key issue in wide - field time - series photometry is the removal of temporal systematics from a single image frame or several consecutive image frames . \n it has recently become known that systematic trends in time - series data can be different and localized within the image frame when the fov is large . such spatially localized patterns may be related to subtle point spread function ( psf ) differences and sky condition within the detector fov ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n as these patterns change in time , we can see how the temporal variations of systematic trends affect the brightness and shape of light curves directly . \n the time - scale of systematic variation is sometimes comparable to short - term variability , such as transits or eclipses , and in some cases even long - term variability . \n thus , it is often difficult to identify and characterize true variabilities .    in this paper \n , we introduce a new photometry procedure , called multi - aperture indexing , which is suited to analyzing well - sampled wide - field images of non - crowded fields with a highly varying psf , such as those produced by wide - field mosaic imagers on large telescopes . \n we apply this procedure to archival imaging data from the mmt / megacam transit survey of the open cluster m37 ( hartman et al . \n 2008a ) , demonstrating a substantial improvement over the existing photometry . \n section 2 describes the mmt imaging database and identifies problems in the existing photometry which motivated the development of our new methods . \n section 3 describes the multi - aperture photometry that utilize newly defined contamination index and carefully tuned calibration procedures , including the results of the basic tests to validate our approach . \n section 4 gives an in - depth discussion about systematic trends in time - series data and suggests an efficient way for identifying , measuring , and removing spatio - temporal trends . \n section 5 describes the effects of new calibration on period search , and we summarize our main results in the last section . \n @xcite have conducted a study to find neptune - sized planets transiting solar - like stars in the rich open cluster m37 . \n the observing strategy was carefully designed for a transiting planet search by several considerations ( e.g. , the reliability of exposure time per frame , the effects of pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations , and sensitivity of filter ) . \n their work did not reveal any transiting planets , but it did provide a rare opportunity to explore photometric variability at relatively high temporal resolution with 3090 s. @xcite discovered 1430 new variable stars , including very short - period eclipsing binaries ( e.g. , v37 , v706 , v1160 ) and @xmath1 sct - type pulsating stars ( e.g. , v397 , v744 , v1412 ) . \n we used the same data set on the open cluster m37 . \n a detailed discussion of the observations , original data reduction , and light curve production is described in @xcite . \n the data archive consists of approximately 5000 @xmath2-filter images taken over 24 nights with the wide - field mosaic imager ( megacam ) mounted at the @xmath3 cassegrain focus of the 6.5 m mmt telescope . \n note that megacam is made up of 36 2048 @xmath4 4608 pixel ccd chips in a @xmath5 pattern , covering a 24@xmath6@xmath424@xmath6 fov @xcite . \n this instrument has an unbinned pixel scale of @xmath7 , but it was used in @xmath8 binning mode for readout . \n the observation logs are summarized in table 1 of @xcite . in brief , the @xmath9-band time - series observations were undertaken between 2005 december 21 and 2006 january 21 , with a median fwhm of @xmath10 arcsec . \n exposure times are chosen to keep an @xmath11 mag star as close to the saturation limit , which is expressed as a function of seeing conditions . with an average seeing @xmath00@xmath12.89 on images , \n the quality of the images is good to achieve high - precision light curves ( less than 1% rms value ) down to 20 . \n in addition to the imaging data set , this database includes light curve data sets for a total of 23,790 sources detected in a co - added reference image . \n theses light curves are obtained by the image subtraction technique using a modified version of isis software ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    as shown in figure [ fig : fig1 ] , however , the raw light curves from the original image subtraction procedures exhibit many unusual outliers , and more than @xmath015% of data get rejected by a simple filtering algorithm after cleaning procedures . in practice , brutal filtering that is often applied to remove outlying data points can result in the loss of vital data , with seriously negative impact to short - term variations such as flares and deep eclipses . \n we also find that the image subtraction technique often resulted in measurement failures from several frames due to poor seeing or tracking problem . after removing these bad frames \n , it leads to loss of additional @xmath05% data points from most light curves . in order to overcome this problem , \n we have re - processed the entire image database with new photometric reduction procedures . \n 3-@xmath13 control limits ( dotted lines ) . \n these light curves contain outlier points that significantly increase the rms scatter of the raw light curves . ] \n we followed the standard ccd reduction procedures of the bias correction , overscan trimming , dark correction , and flat - fielding as described in @xcite . \n the individual ccd frames were calibrated in iraf , using the mosaic data reduction package megared . \n the first step is to correct the pixel - to - pixel zero - point differences that are usually described by the sum of a mean bias level and a bias structure . \n as the bias frames were not separately taken during the time of the observations , the mean bias level was subtracted from each image extension using an overscan correction and so we can not remove any remaining bias structure from all overscan - subtracted data frames . according to description in matt ashby s megacam reduction guide , the bias structure can be very significant in some small regions such as the portions of the arrays close to the readout leads . \n the dark currents are normally insignificant for megacam so that corrections are not needed even for long exposures . \n the next step is to correct pixel - to - pixel variations in the sensitivity of the ccd ; we used the program ` domegacamflat2 ` . \n this program determines the scaling factors to correct the gain difference between the two amplifiers of each chip by finding the mode in the quotient of pixels to the left and right of the amplifier boundary , and then flattens each of the frames with a master flat field frame . \n it is worth mentioning that the sky conditions were rarely photometric during the observing run , with persistent light cirrus for most of the nights . \n therefore it was only possible to obtain twilight sky flats on a handful of nights ( dome flats were not possible ) . \n we removed bad pixels using the megacam bad pixel masks distributed with the megared package . \n the values of bad pixels are replaced with interpolated value of the surrounding pixels using the iraf task ` fixpix ` . \n the numerous single pixel events ( cosmic - rays ) were identified and removed using the lacosmic package @xcite . \n the megacam data already have a rough world coordinates system ( wcs ) solution that is based on a single value of the telescope pointing . \n to update these with a more precise solution , we applied astrometric correction to each ccd in the mosaic using the wcstools imwcs program @xcite . \n the new solution is derived by minimizing the differences between the r.a . and decl . \n positions of sources in a single ccd chip and their positions listed in the 2mass point source catalog @xcite . \n the resulting astrometric accuracy is typically better than 0@xmath14.1 rms in both r.a . and decl . \n typically , a point or extended source detection algorithm is applied to each frame independently and it always requires criteria for what should be regarded as a true detection . in obtaining the pixel coordinates for all objects in the m37 fields , this procedure often misses some objects when the detection threshold approaches the noise level . \n also it needs a substantial effort to match the objects that are detected in only some of the frames . \n our approach is as follows : a complete list of all objects is obtained from a co - added reference frame , and then the photometry is performed for each frame using the fixed positions of the sources detected on the reference . since the relative centroid positions of all objects are the same for all frames in the time series , we can easily place an aperture on each target and measure the flux even for the stars at the faint magnitude end . \n we constructed the reference frame for each chip from the best seeing frames using the swarp software . \n benefiting from a highly accurate astrometric calibration of input frames , we were able to improve the quality of co - added images . in the swarp implementation \n , the pixels of each frame were resampled using the lanczos3 convolution kernel , then combined into the reference frame by taking a median or average . \n after this was done , sources were detected and extracted on the reference frame using the sextractor software @xcite . \n when configured with a lower detection threshold , sextractor extracts the number of spurious detections ( e.g. , diffraction spikes around bright stars , or outer features of bright galaxies ) . \n these false detections were removed by careful visual inspection for each chip . \n the final catalog contains a total of 30,294 objects including both point and extended sources . \n prior to the photometry , the initial centroid coordinates of the target objects for each frame were computed by using the wcstools sky2xy routine @xcite . \n the stored world coordinate system for each frame is used to convert the ( r.a . \n , decl . ) coordinates from the master source catalog to the @xmath15 pixel locations . \n however , actual positions of objects for each frame can be slightly moved from its original locations depending on the focus condition of instrument , seeing condition , and the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) in the individual observations . \n these types of positioning errors ( i.e. , centroid noise ) will lead to the internal error for a photometric measurement that results from placement of the measuring aperture on the object being measured . \n the situation gets worse for faint stars because the centroid position of them is itself subject to some uncertainty . the fractional error in the measured flux as a result of mis - centering \n is given by:@xmath16 where @xmath17 is the positioning error , @xmath18 is the radius of aperture , @xmath13 is the profile width for a source with a gaussian psf , and total flux @xmath19 ( see appendix a in irwin et al . , 2007 for details ) . \n this expression shows that if we set the aperture radius equal to the fwhm ( @xmath18=2.35-@xmath13 ) , even small differences in placement of the aperture ( e.g. , @xmath17=0.1-@xmath13 ) may increase the uncertainty in the flux measurements ( @xmath20 1 mmag ) . \n thus , accurate centroid determination is important to achieve the high - precision photometry .    following the windowed centroid procedure in the sextractor \n , a refined centroid of each object is calculated iteratively . \n on average , the rms uncertainty in the coordinate transformation using the wcs information was @xmath21 pixels for the bright reference stars . \n after the coordinate transformation from sky to @xmath22 , however , the centroid coordinates ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) are slightly misaligned from their actual ones ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) . \n the refined centroid values ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) are used only if the maximum displacement is at least less than 1.5 pixels . \n this condition prevents arbitrary shifting of a source centroid , especially for faint stars . \n we estimated a local sky background by measuring the mode of the histogram of pixel values within a local annulus around each object , which is suitable choice for our uncrowded field ( less than @xmath01000 stars per chip ) . \n this process is a combination of @xmath29-@xmath13 clipping and mode estimation . \n the background histogram is clipped iteratively at @xmath303-@xmath13 around its median , and then the mode value is taken as : @xmath31 it represents the most probable sky value of a randomly chosen pixel in the sample of sky pixels @xcite . \n for relatively crowded regions , we utilized a background map created by sextractor package using a mesh of @xmath32 pixels and a median filter box of @xmath33 pixels . \n this map is used to confirm the properness of individual sky values from annulus estimates . \n modern data reduction techniques aim to reach photon noise limit and minimize systematic effects . \n for example , differential photometry technique can be achieved better than 1% precision for brighter stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the deconvolution - based photometry algorithm leads to the minimization of systematic effects in very crowded fields ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however \n , conventional data reduction methods often fail to handle various artifacts in wide - field survey data . \n we present below a new photometric reduction method for precise time - series photometry of non - crowded fields , without the need to involve complicated and cpu intensive process ( e.g. , psf fitting or difference image analysis ) . \n our photometry is similar to standard aperture photometry , except in that we compute the flux in a sequence of several apertures and then determine the optimum aperture individually to each object at each epoch . \n this multi - aperture photometry is an efficient way to determine the optimum aperture size that gives the maximum s / n for a flux measurement . the maximum s / n is not necessarily at the same aperture for all objects , and it can be obtained from a relatively small aperture @xcite . \n this _ photometric _ \n aperture is to achieve the optimal balance between flux loss and noises based on a relationship derived from the ccd equation ( see @xcite ) . \n figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows how the optimum apertures vary with the stellar magnitude . \n there is an obvious trend of decreasing aperture sizes with increasing magnitudes down to the faint magnitude limit in the example frame . \n once we measure the flux of each object with the optimum aperture , we need to apply the aperture correction for small apertures . \n the aperture correction terms are estimated from the growth curve analysis of selected isolated bright stars ( i.e. , reference stars ) . \n the average curve - of - growth for each frame is calculated by measuring the difference in magnitude between different pairs of apertures ( up to 10 pixels aperture radius ) and then an automatic correction is applied to all objects for each photometric aperture . \n the use of a common aperture correction for each ccd assumes that there is no variation in the correction across the ccd . \n this flux correction method gives nearly the same brightness within the measurement uncertainties for all apertures . \n any psf variation across the ccd causes systematic errors , however , and we deal with this in section 3.4 and section 4 .    100 thumbnail images of the target star . _ \n middle panels _ : normalized s / n as a function of aperture size . _ bottom panels _ : aperture corrected magnitude as a function of aperture size . \n the arrows represent the peak locations in the aperture - s / n diagram ( see text for details ) . ] \n we performed the multi - aperture photometry based on the concentric aperture photometry algorithm in daophot package @xcite , using several circular apertures ( up to 10 pixels aperture radius ) with a fixed sky annulus from 35 to 45 pixels . \n the initial results of multi - aperture photometry are stored in ascii - format photometry tables , including the date of the observations ( mjd ) , the pixel @xmath15 coordinates , the aperture - corrected magnitudes with errors for each aperture , the sky values and its errors . \n figure [ fig : fig3 ] shows the details of the multi - aperture photometry for one star at different epochs . in the former two epochs , the photometric apertures can be properly selected by the s / n cuts , while in the latter two epochs , s / n increases for lager apertures . \n this unusual behavior is due to contamination by a moving object . \n we automatically identifies similar unusual cases by the method of aperture indexing . \n -filter light curve of same star ( id=10213 ) as shown in figure [ fig : fig3 ] . \n bottom panels show the multi - aperture indexing scheme . \n the @xmath34-axis is the aperture size and @xmath35 @xmath36-axis is the differential magnitude between pairs of apertures @xmath37(=@xmath38 ) . \n we can see whether and at what aperture the differential magnitude ( solid lines ) begins to deviate from the model curve ( dashed lines ) for each epoch . ] \n our multi - aperture indexing method is similar to the basic concept of the discrete curve - of - growth method @xcite . \n each object is indexed based on the difference in aperture - corrected magnitude between pairs of apertures @xmath37(=@xmath38 ) with mean trend for stars of similar brightness ( see solid and dotted lines in bottom panels of figure [ fig : fig4 ] , respectively ) . \n the aperture with a 10 pixel radius is used as the fixed reference aperture . \n the mean trend is determined by computing the rms curve of the aperture correction values for all measured apertures , and used to evaluate whether magnitude at a given aperture significantly differs from the mean trend . \n since the rms value depends on the chosen magnitude interval , all stars are divided into groups according to their brightness in the individual frames . \n we determine the rms curve for each magnitude group using an iterative @xmath13-clipping until convergence is reached . \n objects lying within @xmath303-@xmath13 of the model curve are indexed as contamination - free , and those above @xmath303-@xmath13 as a contaminated source . \n figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows that multi - aperture indexing guides us to throw out some photometric measurements if they are discrepant from the mean trend . \n this approach also gives us a chance to recover a measurement that would be otherwise thrown out . \n the problematic aperture can be simply replaced by one of the smaller apertures if it is indexed as contamination - free . \n this help us make a full use of the information offered by the data . \n we present a new photometric calibration to convert the instrumental magnitudes onto the standard system , including a relative flux correction of the left and right half - region of each ccd chip . \n as mentioned in the section 3.1 , mmt / megacam shows the temporal variations in the gain between two amplifiers on each ccd , as well as between ccds that are part of the same mosaic . \n it may have been caused by unstable bias voltage of the ccd output drain which has a profound impact on the gain of the output amplifier . \n the level of readout noise is also unstable between two amplifiers . to correct for this effect \n , the photometric calibration needs to be performed individually for each amplifier region . \n we use a sufficient number of ( pre - selected ) bright isolated stars as standard stars and compute the relative flux correction terms . \n these terms were derived for each frame using the mean magnitude offset ( @xmath39 ) of standard stars ( @xmath40 ) with respect to corresponding magnitudes ( @xmath41 ) in the master frame chosen as an internal photometric reference    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the aperture - corrected instrumental magnitudes in other frames and @xmath44 is the photometric zero - points for the left- and right - side of each chip , respectively . to calculate the zero - points , we solve \n a linear calibration relation of the form : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are standard magnitudes from the photometric catalog of m37 @xcite and @xmath48 is an airmass term . \n the fit is performed iteratively using a sigma - clipping method . \n figure [ fig : fig5 ] shows the difference in the magnitude offsets between the left- and right - side of each chip ( @xmath49 ) for the whole data set , which is within @xmath50 magnitude level for all 36 ccd chips . \n the histograms are normalized by the total number of data frames @xmath51 and are described by a gaussian function with slightly different mean values and shapes ( dashed line ) . \n we clearly see a significant variation in difference between a pair of magnitude offsets for all ccds .      the photometric calibration for wide - field imaging systems is also affected by position - dependent systematic errors due to a psf variation across the fov ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n we derive psf variations across the fov with the sextractor package . \n the change of the psf shapes in the image plane is represented by spatial distribution of psf fwhm values for several bright stars , with parameters of ` class\\_star ` @xmath52 0.9 , ` magerr\\_auto ` @xmath53 0.01 mag , and ` flags ` = 0 ( i.e. , isolated point sources with no contamination ) . \n note that the psf fwhm values are defined as the diameter of the disk that contains half of the object flux based on a circular gaussian kernel . \n figure [ fig : fig6 ] presents the variation of the psf fwhm as a function of distance from the image center for various seeing conditions . for each quadrant , \n the dashed lines represent the weighted spline approximation of the median value of each distance bin ( 1 arcmin ) . \n the result shows that the psf fwhm varies significantly as a function of position on the single - epoch image frames and variations are at the level of @xmath010% to 20% ( @xmath54 ) across the fov . as the field distortion is not negligible from the center of field to its edges , \n such variations limit the accuracy of stellar photometry .        to address this issue , we perform a 2d polynomial fitting technique . for each frame , the correction terms are described by a linear or quadratic polynomial depending on the position @xmath55 only . \n @xmath56    where @xmath57 are the pixel coordinates of @xmath58 bright isolated stars , @xmath59 is the statistical weight in the fitting procedure , @xmath60 are the sets of polynomial coefficients for each aperture size , and @xmath61 are the difference in magnitude between the reference aperture and @xmath62 aperture , @xmath63 , at the position @xmath55 for each chip @xmath64 . \n we derived the optimal parameter values from a nonlinear least - squares fit using the levenberg \n marquardt algorithm and automatic differentiation , and choose between two models that best fit the data . \n figure [ fig : fig7 ] shows the field - dependent magnitude offsets and the distortion correction by 2d polynomial fitting method for one example mosaic ccd . for the outer and the central region of the mosaic , we compare the magnitude offsets between the reference aperture and the relatively smaller apertures as a function of @xmath55 coordinates . here \n @xmath34-axis is in the declination direction and @xmath36-axis is opposite to the right ascension direction . \n we find that the magnitude difference depends on position @xmath15 and is most discrepant in the outer part of the fov . \n this effect is usually more significant in the @xmath36-direction than in the @xmath34-direction , especially for the case of aperture photometry performed with small apertures . \n the correction for field - dependent psf variation reduces the initial @xmath010% variation ( gray lines ) to less than @xmath01% ( black lines ) .    . \n ]        we compare the photometric performance of the re - calibrated light curves with the non - de - trended archival light curves by means of the two representative measures : ( i ) the rms photometric precision @xmath65 , and ( ii ) the data recovery rate @xmath66 . \n the former is defined as the standard deviation of light curves around the mean value as a function of @xmath46 magnitude : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the number of data points in each light curve , @xmath69 is the observed magnitude , and @xmath70 is the mean magnitude of the object @xmath71 , and the latter refers to the number of _ analyzed _ data frames normalized by the total number of observed data frames @xmath58 for each object . in typical cases , the data recovery rate should be near unity in the bright magnitude regime and decreases with magnitude for fainter objects . for comparison , we decided to select light curve samples which show either no significant variability or seeing - correlated variations induced by image blending . \n we remove all known variable stars from the sample list based on a new catalog of variable stars in m37 field ( s .- w . \n chang et al . \n 2015 , hereafter paper ii ) . to remove the light curves of blended objects \n , we use an empirical statistical technique to quantify the level of blending by looking for seeing - correlated shifts of the object from its median magnitude @xcite . \n @xmath72 where @xmath73 for light curve points @xmath69 with uncertainties @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the same statistic measured with respect to a fourth order polynomial in fwhm fitted to the data . \n we adopt the value @xmath76 for the selecting light curves with no blending . \n the last selection criterion is that the light curves must exit both in the archive and our database .    in the bottom panels of figure [ fig : fig8 ] and figure [ fig : fig9 ] , we plot the rms photometric precision of light curves for the two megacam ccd chips in the outer ( ccd 1 ) and central ( ccd 21 ) part of the fov , respectively . \n the black points show the rms values of the re - calibrated light curves , while the gray points are for the raw and filtered light curves in archive . \n the first impression from this comparison is that the typical rms scatter is overestimated from the raw light curves because of many outliers in the photometric data ( bottom left panels ) . for the better results , \n these light curves were filtered out in two steps : ( i ) clipping 5-@xmath13 outliers from each light curve and ( ii ) removing every data points that are outliers in a large number of light curves @xcite . in the second step , \n the outlier candidates are estimated by choosing a cutoff value for each ccd chip . \n the cutoff value is defined as the fraction of light curves for which a given image is a 3-@xmath13 outlier . \n this filtering was applied to remove bad measurements due to image artifacts or poor conditions , which were previously thought to be unrecoverable , but resulting data loss is up to 20% of the total number of data points ( bottom right panels ) . as shown in the top panels of the two figures , \n the data recovery rate for the re - calibrated light curves is close to 100@xmath77 over a wide range of magnitude and it appears to be more complete compared with the raw ( top left panels ) and filtered ( top right panels ) light curves . at bright magnitudes ( @xmath78 ) \n the data recovery rate does not reach 100@xmath77 because the exposure time was chosen to be saturated at a magnitude of @xmath11 . \n this comparison proves that our approach is a powerful strategy for improving overall photometric accuracy without the need to throw out many outlier data points . \n finally , we compare the light curves themselves for selected variable stars between the archive and our own . \n this comparison serves to illustrate how the photometric precision and data recovery rate of the time - series data affect the ability to address a variety of variability characteristics . \n figure [ fig : fig10 ] shows a direct comparison with the filtered light curves ( top panels ) and our re - calibrated light curves ( bottom panels ) for four variable stars . \n it is shown that our method recovers more data points ( black ) from the same data set of images . \n and @xmath36 coordinates , respectively , for selected ccd chips . \n the filled squares are relatively bright stars with @xmath79 mag , while the open squares are stars with @xmath80 mag . ]      in order to further investigate possible systematics in our approach , we conducted psf - fitting photometry with daophot ii and allstar @xcite . \n for each mosaic frame , we select bright , isolated , and unsaturated stars to make the psf model varying quadratically with @xmath55 coordinates . \n after psf modeling , we run allstar to perform iterative psf photometry of all detected sources in the frame with initial centroids set to the same values used for our own photometry . \n we then calculated aperture corrections using the package daogrow @xcite after subtraction of all but psf stars , which creates aperture growth curves for each frame and then integrates them out to infinity to obtain a total magnitude for each psf star . \n the final step is to convert the instrumental magnitudes into the standard photometric system . for each frame , the initial zero - point correction is applied by correcting the magnitude offset with respect to the master frame . \n this places photometry for all frames on a common instrumental system . \n following the same procedure in section 3.3 , the photometric calibration is performed individually for each amplifier region . \n figure [ fig : fig11 ] shows the residual magnitudes and sky values between our multi - aperture photometry and the psf - fitting photometry as a function of position in the selected ccd chips . \n there are no position - dependent trends in the magnitude residuals . for the brighter stars with @xmath79 mag , \n the rms magnitude difference between the two methods is very small ( @xmath81 = @xmath82 and @xmath83 = @xmath84 , respectively ) , while for the relatively faint stars the rms difference is somewhat larger ( @xmath81 = @xmath85 and @xmath83 = @xmath86 , respectively ) . \n the results of this example indicate that we can reliably correct for the psf variations by our calibration procedures \n . meanwhile , our sky values are slightly higher than the allstar sky values , but not to the degree that can seriously affect photometric measurements . \n magnitude in the central region of the open cluster m37 ( left panel ) . \n the arrows indicate the three different magnitude levels from bright to faint in our sample shown in the right panels . \n note that the variable object ids are taken from the new variable catalog of the m37 ( see paper ii ) . ] \n figure [ fig : fig12 ] shows a comparison of the rms dispersion of the light curves obtained with our photometry with respect to the that of the psf - fitting photometry in the central region of the open cluster m37 . \n we only compare the light curves of non - blended objects as described in section 3.5 . \n our multi - aperture photometry does not reach the same level of precision as psf - fitting photometry for the faintest stars , while the psf - fitting approach results in poorer photometry for bright stars . \n as shown in the right panels of figure [ fig : fig12 ] , it is clear that our photometry tend to have smaller measurement errors with respect to the psf photometry for the bright stars . \n -axis indicate the corresponding timestamps in each frame . \n the deviations from the mean value , @xmath87 , are less than @xmath300.01 mag level ( with a rms values of 0.0021 , 0.0025 , and 0.0033 mag from the top panel down ) . \n these stars show a similar pattern of light variations over the observation span . ] \n from a visual inspection of the re - calibrated light curves in the same ccd chip , we found that some light curves tend to have the same pattern of variations over the observation span ( figure [ fig : fig13 ] ) . \n this kind of systematic variation ( i.e. , _ trend _ ) is often noticed in other studies . \n for example , the importance of minimizing known ( or unknown ) systematics have been recognized by several exo - planet surveys because planet detection performance can be easily damaged by them ( e.g.,@xcite ) . \n also space - based time - series data ( e.g. , corot and kepler ) are no exception to this behavior although it is completely free from systematics caused by the turbulent atmosphere . \n most of the raw light curves are affected by a secular ( or a sudden ) variation of flux without any obvious physical reason @xcite .    in order to check the properties of temporal systematics \n , we examined the correlation coefficients as measure of similarity between two light curves @xmath47 and @xmath71 obtained from a single ccd chip ( ccd 1 ) . \n @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the flux of each star at time @xmath90 , @xmath58 is the total number of measurements , @xmath91 is the mean flux of each star , and @xmath13 is the standard deviation of @xmath89 . \n this comparison is a point - by - point comparison and is done for every pair of light curves in the data set . \n the resultant similarity matrix can be used to identify correlated pairs of light curves and to determine which light curve is least like all other light curves ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n after that , we selected stars showing most systematics based on a hierarchical clustering method with the correlation coefficients ( see @xcite , for more details ) . \n figure [ fig : fig14 ] represents spatial distribution of the most prominent trend groups on the ccd plane ( top panel ) and its strongly correlated features determined by the weighted sum of normalized light curves ( bottom panel ) . \n there are two interesting features in this figure : the first one is that each trend covers only a certain part of the sky area and the second one is that some portions of neighboring trends show different variation patterns even at the same moment in time ( shaded gray region in the figure ) . in particular , we found an anti - correlated variation for the trends between the group 1 ( @xmath92 ) and the group 2 ( @xmath93 ) , so we might expect to find possible noise sources that are responsible for these discrepancies . \n why the trends are different and localized within a single ccd frame is a subject of further study , but it is probably related to subtle changes in point spread function and sky condition within the detector fov .     and @xmath94 ) of stars . \n the numbers on the @xmath34-axis indicate the corresponding timestamps between the frame 1 and the frame 400 . from the top to bottom , the panels show the average difference of trend , flux concentrations in which we applied a @xmath95 mag shift to the @xmath96 value , sky level , and psf fwhm value between the two groups . ]    , for the original multi - aperture magnitude measurements as a function of aperture size , which is marked with a gray dots in all panels . \n a positive @xmath97 indicates that the photometric measurements with the corresponding aperture size , @xmath98 , are brighter than those of reference aperture @xmath99 , while a negative @xmath97 indicates vise versa . \n the dashed lines are the rms model profiles introduced in section 3.2.2 . \n there is a noticeable distinction between the group 1 ( _ top panels _ ) and group 2 ( _ bottom panels _ ) when looked at different concentration levels . \n but the trends are not fully explained by the difference patterns in @xmath97 because those correlated variations become small after the correction for the psf variation ( black dots ) . ]    for these two groups , we consider a possible causal relationship between the systematic trends and average object / image properties . \n figure [ fig : fig15 ] shows the differences in trend , differential magnitudes , sky level , and psf fwhm between the two groups , respectively . in the top panel , we plot the magnitude difference in trends , which shows variations in the range of @xmath50 mag . \n we suspect that this may be due to the different concentration of star light between these two groups \n . it can be checked by using the magnitude difference @xmath100 , where @xmath99 and @xmath98 are the reference aperture and the relatively small aperture , respectively . \n in fact , we already know that there is a magnitude variation in @xmath37 depend on the aperture size due to the field - dependent psf variation ( see section 3.4 ) . for example , figure [ fig : fig16 ] shows the response of multi - aperture photometry for the two groups of stars at one epoch ( mjd = 53726.14817 ) before and after applying the distortion corrections . \n although the magnitude variation between the group 1 and the group 2 seems to have different behavior as a function of aperture size ( gray points ) , it is negligible after the removal of the psf variation ( black points ) . \n we also check that the possible contribution of sky level ( @xmath101 ) and psf fwhm differences ( @xmath102 ) to the systematic trends on the re - calibrated light curves . as mentioned by @xcite , sky over - subtraction \n may lead to the systematic trends as a function of the psf fwhm , the amplitude of which increase for fainter stars . \n the third and forth panels of figure [ fig : fig15 ] show the variation of the mean @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively . in our case , however , the form and amplitude of trends seem independent of sky level and psf fwhm . \n some other possible sources that may contribute to the observed systematic trends include : higher order variations in the psf shape beyond just the fwhm ; cross - talk from other amplifiers , or ghosts from bright stars undergoing multiple reflections within the optics ; non - uniform variations in the gain ; and unmodeled temporal atmospheric variations that are dominated by rayleigh scattering , molecular absorption by ozone and water vapor , and aerosol scattering @xcite . \n while we find a clear presence of trends that should be removed , we are not able to identify their exact cause .      in order to reduce systematic effects in photometric time - series data , several methods were introduced ( e.g. , tfa : @xcite ; sys - rem : @xcite ; pdt : @xcite ; cda : @xcite ; pdc : @xcite ) . \n all of these algorithms share a common advantage that they work without any prior knowledge of the systematic effects . \n we use the pdt algorithm , which has been designed to detect and remove spatially localized patterns . by default \n , this algorithm works with a set of light curves that contain the same number of data points distributed in the same series of epoch . in many cases , however , \n missing data occur when no photometric measurements are available for some stars in a given observed frame . \n these missing data can be simply replaced by means , medians , or the values from the interpolation of adjacent data points in each light curve ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n although using the replaced value is the easiest way to reconstruct the light curve to be analyzed , it is not appropriate if the time separation between two subsequent observations is too large . \n instead we use more straightforward approach by applying the pdt algorithm in two separate steps : ( i ) we construct the master trends from the subset of bright stars , and ( ii ) de - trend light curves of all stars with most similar master trend and matching time line .    -axis indicate the corresponding timestamps between the frame 1 and the frame 2000 . \n the @xmath36-axis is @xmath46-filter magnitude ( normalized by its mean value ) . \n while the morphology of the two light curves in the left panels appear to be variable stars of some kind , these turn out to be non - variable after applying the photometric de - trending method . in the case of the right panels , \n all true variabilities are preserved from the raw light curves . from upper left \n to lower right : id=10032 , id=10039 , id=170088 , and id=170108 . ] \n we briefly describe the main procedure of our de - trending process following the algorithm derived by @xcite . \n we first select the template light curves from bright stars that show the highest correlation in the light - curve features . \n the total length of template light curves should be long enough to cover the whole time span of observations . in this step , we take a sequence of data points , @xmath103 as the reference time line . using the correlation matrix calculated from equation ( 7 ) , we extract all subset of light curves that show spatio - temporally correlated features ( i.e. , clusters ) . \n each cluster is determined by hierarchical tree clustering algorithm based on the degree of similarity . \n next , we obtain master trends @xmath104 for each cluster by weighted average of the normalized differential light curves , @xmath105 : @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the total number of light curves in each cluster @xmath64 , @xmath110 is mean value of _ i light curve , and @xmath111 is the standard deviation of @xmath105 . after determining the master trends , we de - trend the light curves of all stars with matching master trend and time line . \n we adjust the temporal sequence of measurements for the master trends @xmath112 by that of individual light curves to be de - trended @xmath113 . because each light curve is assumed as a linear combination of master trends and noise \n , we can determine the optimal solution by minimizing the residual between the master trends and the light curve : @xmath114 @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the total number of master trends and @xmath117 are free parameters to be determined by means of minimization of noise term @xmath118 . \n _    figure [ fig : fig17 ] shows examples of our light curves before and after removing the systematic trends . \n the algorithm we used for de - trending removes only the systematic variations that are shared by light curves of stars in the adjacent sky regions ( left panels ) , while all kinds of true variabilities are preserved ( right panels ) . \n ( indicated by arrow ) . \n the phased diagram of this candidate frequency is shown in the low - right panel . \n we see that the model fits well the overall pulsating variability ( red line ) . ]    , but the subfigure of low - right panel is 200@xmath4200 thumbnail image of the target star . \n there is no potential sources of contamination to hamper the interpretation of the power spectrum . ] \n the usefulness of our photometry is tested for a set of variable stars . \n we immediately find abundant cases of improvements in the following three aspects : ( i ) refinement of the derived period , ( ii ) detection of a new significant peak in the periodogram , and ( iii ) separation of non - variable candidates where systematics in the light curves were mistaken for true variability . \n for each case , we compare light curves and power spectra for archival data and our data . \n for the first example , we show that a new photometric measurement and calibration allowed us to derive a much improved refinement of the light curves and of the derived periods ( figure [ fig : fig18 ] ) . we performed a lomb - scargle ( l - s : @xcite ) search of both archival and new light curves for periodic variable star ( v427 ) . \n the light curves are folded by the best - fit period of 5.4615 and 4.4158 days , respectively . \n we also calculated the false - alarm probability ( @xmath119 fap ) for each peak and its signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) : @xmath119 fap@xmath120 = @xmath121 , s / n@xmath120 = 43.2 for the archival data and @xmath119 fap@xmath122 = @xmath123 , s / n@xmath122 = 84.5 for the new data . \n since we can get better estimation with much lowered minimum fap value , our new period is the most likely result . in the bottom panels , \n the resulting amplitude spectrum was calculated with ` period04 ` package . \n since the archival data is more noisy than the new one , it is rather complicated to interpret the peaks of its power spectrum .    for the second example , we show the newly discovered low - amplitude pulsating variable star ( figure [ fig : fig19 ] ) . \n we used the ` period04 ` package to find multiple pulsation periods . \n the whole process of identifying , fitting , and pre - whitening successive frequencies was repeated until no significant frequencies were found . \n we adopt a conservative approach in selecting the statistical significant peaks from the amplitude spectrum \n . a s / n amplitude ratio of 4.0 is a good criterion for independent frequencies , equivalent to 99.9% certainty of variability @xcite . \n while no clear periodicity was found in the archive data , our amplitude spectrum shows a clear excess of power centered at 22.3979 days@xmath124 with peak amplitudes of about 1 mmag ( s / n@xmath122 = 9.02 ) . \n the last example is the opposite case of the second . \n figure [ fig : fig20 ] shows that this object is unlikely to be a variable source because there is no evidence for any significant peaks , which indicates that the variations are mostly noise . \n extensive study on variabilities will be presented in paper ii . \n in this paper , we introduce a new time - series photometry with multi - aperture indexing and spatio - temporal de - trending techniques , together with complex corrections to minimize instrumental biases . \n we used the archival , high - temporal time - series data from one - month long mmt / megacam transit survey program . \n the re - calibration of the archival data has made several improvements as follows : ( i ) the photometric information derived from the multi - aperture indexing measurements is useful to obtain the best s / n measurement , but also to diagnose whether or not the targets are contaminated ; ( ii ) the resulting light curves utilize nearly 100% of available data and reach precisions down to sub mmag level at the bright magnitude end without the need to throw out many outlier data points , which makes it possible to preserve data points that show intrinsic sudden variations such as flare events ; ( iii ) corrections for position - dependent psf variations and de - trending of spatio - temporal systematic trends improve the quality of light curves ; and ( iv ) new photometry enables us to determine the variability nature and period estimate more accurately .    while this study deals with a particular set of data from mmt \n , we find our approach has a potential for other wide - field time - series observations . \n multi - aperture indexing measurement is a powerful tool in isolating and even correcting various contaminations . \n spatio - temporal de - trending is also very useful in removing systematics caused by psf variation and even non - uniform extinction of thin clouds across the fov . \n @xcite proved this for different sets of archival survey data . \n this research was supported by basic science research program of the national research foundation of korea ( 2011 -

[ \n fig : colours ] ) . \n we have integrated the atmospheric models of canonical - mass 0.6@xmath9  ( @xmath18  @xmath19 ) white dwarfs of @xcite with the various filter profiles to guide our colour cuts , similar to @xcite . \n our photometric selection recovered kic4552982 , the first zzceti star in the _ kepler _ field @xcite . \n we narrowed our selection to a small region around kic4552982 and to candidates close to the empirical ( @xmath3 , @xmath20  @xmath6 ) instability strip projected into @xmath21 space . \n this left more than 60 white dwarf candidates , 43 of which we were able to follow up spectroscopically ( table  [ phot - summary ] ) . \n we were awarded a total of eight nights on the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( wht ) in 2012 , 2013 , and 2014 , where we obtained intermediate resolution spectra of 43 of our candidates in order to confirm their identities as white dwarf stars and to characterize their atmospheric parameters , especially their effective temperatures and surface gravities . \n we used the intermediate - dispersion spectrograph and imaging system ( isis ) , with the r600r and r600b gratings on the red and blue arms , respectively . \n the slit widths were chosen close to the seeing of each night to maximize spectral resolution ( @xmath22 ) . \n a full journal of observations is included in table  [ tab : specjour ] . \n the blue arm was centred at 4351  and the red arm at 6562 . \n the spectra covered a wavelength range from roughly @xmath23  in the blue ( see fig .  [ spec - fit ] ) , and roughly @xmath24  in the red \n . however , since the higher - order balmer lines contain the most information about the atmospheric parameters ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we only used the blue arm for our balmer profile fits ( section  [ sec : atmosparams ] ) . \n .journal of spectroscopic observations . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      in addition to the confirmation of nine new zzceti stars , our ground - based photometry has put relatively strong limits on the lack of photometric variability in eight other white dwarfs with effective temperatures near the zzceti instability strip . \n those limits are quoted as a 3@xmath25 threshold in table  [ astero - summary ] , and represented visually with a ft for each object in figure  [ fig : ftnewnov ] . \n several of these non - variable white dwarfs have atmospheric parameters that place them within the empirical zzceti instability strip given their uncertainties , most recently updated by @xcite . \n it has been assumed that all white dwarfs in this region can foster a partial ionization zone and thus pulsate  that the instability strip is pure  but this claim is still under review @xcite , although there is good agreement between the observed and theoretical zz ceti instability strip ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n we will not address that issue here , other than to say there are a number of reasons why these objects may appear not to pulsate . \n firstly , it is possible the white dwarfs really do vary , but at lower amplitudes than our detection limits allow ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n additionally , it is possible that subtle issues in the flux calibration of our spectra have introduced unaccounted for systematic uncertainties in the derived atmospheric parameters , and the stars may have true temperatures outside the instability strip . given that the non - variable stars are more or less uniformly distributed in the ( @xmath3 , @xmath26 ) plane , it is likely that the low signal - to - noise of the time - averaged spectra is responsible for some interlopers , as demonstrated quantitatively by @xcite . \n the most interesting white dwarf not observed to vary in our sample is the ultramassive j1926 + 3703 , which sits in the middle of the empirical instability strip . at @xmath27@xmath9 \n , it would be the second - most - massive white dwarf known to pulsate , behind only gd518 @xcite . \n white dwarfs this massive likely have at least partially crystallized interiors . \n we did not detect photometric variability in this relatively faint target ( @xmath28mag ) to a limit of roughly 6.9ppt , but it is quite possible that this white dwarf pulsates at lower amplitude . \n for example , the two most massive known pulsating white dwarfs have low pulsations amplitudes , which rarely exceed 5ppt in a given night and are often far lower in amplitude @xcite . \n the _ kepler _ mission would have given at least an order - of - magnitude improvement on these nov limits , were these targets observed from space . \n for example , @xcite showed that j1909 + 4717 did not vary to at least an amplitude of 0.13ppt using just one month of _ kepler _ data in q4.1 . \n however , only the four known pulsating white dwarfs listed at the end of section  [ sec : confirmationnewzzcetis ] were observed before the spacecraft had a failure of its second reaction wheel . \n we note that many white dwarfs with atmospheric parameters within the empirical instability strip remain unobserved , and we encourage additional follow - up to constrain pulsational variability in these white dwarfs . we especially encourage further monitoring of the ultramassive j1926 + 3703 . \n using photometric colour selection from the kis survey and subsequent medium - resolution spectroscopy from isis on the wht , we have discovered and characterized 42 new white dwarfs in the original _ kepler _ mission field . \n follow - up , high - speed photometry from ground - based telescopes confirmed that at least nine of these objects are zzceti stars . \n four were subsequently observed from space using the _ kepler _ space telescope , and @xcite report on the first zzceti found in this project , kic11911480 . \n asteroseismic inferences from the extended datasets on the other three will be presented in a forthcoming publication . \n unfortunately , the failure of the second and critical reaction wheel that kept _ kepler _ precisely pointed towards its original mission field occurred within months of our discovery of many of these new zzceti stars , and our sparse ground - based discovery light curves are so far the only time - series photometry for most of the targets here . at the end of its roughly four years \n pointed towards its original field , _ kepler _ observed a total of six pulsating white dwarfs . \n however , the two - reaction - wheel controlled _ k2 _ mission will cover a significantly larger footprint as it tours the ecliptic @xcite , and _ \n k2 _ will likely observe more than a thousand white dwarfs , dozens of them pulsating . \n already several important discoveries have come from these _ k2 _ observations of pulsating white dwarfs @xcite . \n the colour selection methods honed in this work have ensured that dozens of pulsating white dwarfs have been or will be observed by _ \n k2 _ for up to 80d at a time , using selection from a variety of multiwavelength photometric surveys . \n the authors acknowledge fruitful conversations with a. gianninas during the preparation of this manuscript . \n the research leading to these results has received funding from the european research council under the european union s seventh framework programme ( fp/2007 -

of - sample extension @xmath17 agrees with these directions . \n although the definition of @xmath79 provides locality for the scheme computation , it is reasonable to require that data points in @xmath79 , which are distant from @xmath16 , affect less than close data points . for this purpose , \n an affection weight @xmath80 is assigned to each data point @xmath81 . \n of course , any other decreasing function of the distance between @xmath16 and @xmath23 can be utilized . by defining the variance @xmath82 to be proportional to the distance @xmath83 such that @xmath84 \n , then we get a diagonal matrix @xmath41 , whose @xmath53-th diagonal element is @xmath85 thus , due to observation  [ obs : mahlanobis ] , close data points in @xmath70 affect @xmath17 more than data points that are far away .      in this section , we present a covariance matrix that encapsulates geometric information concerning the manifold @xmath11 . \n the covariance matrix @xmath41 is set such that the resulted extension obeys the lipschitz property of @xmath8 . \n let @xmath86 be the tangential space to @xmath11 in @xmath57 and let @xmath87 be the orthogonal projection on @xmath86 . \n we denote the tangential component of @xmath25 by @xmath88 , and its orthogonal complement by @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the identity transformation . \n proposition  [ prop : tang -

[ eq : simple w ] ) and the tangential - based weights(eq . \n [ eq : tang weights ] ) . \n it means that for any function @xmath129 , which agrees on a given set of data points and satisfies certain conditions , the out - of - sample extension @xmath17 of the data point @xmath16 is close to @xmath130 . \n first , we prove the consistency of the algorithm . in other words , \n the out - of - sample extension of data points , which coverage to an already known data point , will converge to its already known image . \n [ lemma:5 ] assume @xmath131 . if @xmath132 then @xmath133 . \n an intuition for the proof of lemma [ lemma:5 ] is that the distance from the point @xmath134 is inversely proportional to the weight of the equation @xmath135 in eq . \n [ eq : system_rv ] , therefore , when @xmath136 , the distance tends to @xmath98 and the weight tends to @xmath137 . notice that when @xmath138 then , according to eq . \n [ eq : weights ] , @xmath139 and the out - of - sample extension is undefined . \n the dataset @xmath140 is called a @xmath141-net of the manifold @xmath3 if for any data point @xmath142 there is @xmath143 such that @xmath144 . \n assume that @xmath72 is a @xmath141-net of @xmath3 . \n let @xmath145 be a lipschitz function with a constant @xmath146 . if @xmath147 and @xmath148 is computed using the weights in eq . \n [ eq : simple w ] , then @xmath149 . \n we denote by @xmath150 the set of data points in the @xmath151 neighborhood of @xmath16 . \n it is easy to see that all the data points of @xmath152 are inside a ball @xmath153 of radius @xmath154 . \n therefore , the out - of - sample extension @xmath43 is also in this ball , namely @xmath155 since @xmath8 is a lipschitz function and @xmath156 , we have @xmath157 by combining eqs . and , we get @xmath158 .    next , we show an identical result for the case where the weights from eq . \n [ eq : tang weights ] are utilized to construct the covariance matrix @xmath41 . \n moreover , the approximations of the tangential spaces converge to the correct tangential space as @xmath159 tends to @xmath98 . \n [ thm : main ] let @xmath72 be a @xmath141-net of @xmath3 and let @xmath145 be a lipschitz function with a constant @xmath146 . if @xmath147 and @xmath148 is computed using the weights in eq . \n [ eq : tang weights ] , then @xmath160 . \n let @xmath150 be the @xmath161 neighborhood of @xmath16 . \n then , the weight matrix becomes @xmath162    by using eq . \n , we get @xmath163 where the @xmath127 matrices are defined in eq . \n [ eq : tang weights ] . \n the structure of the @xmath127 matrices allows us to find a basis in which all the matrices @xmath164 become diagonal . \n let us denote the diagonal form of @xmath127 by @xmath165 . \n then @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the transformation matrix . \n we can rewrite eq . to become @xmath168 since all @xmath165 are diagonal \n , we get a weighted average of the data points @xmath152 in the new basis , which is known to be in convex hull . \n thus , it is located inside a ball that contains all the data points . \n it means that @xmath148 is inside a ball of radius @xmath154 that contains all @xmath152 . \n therefore , @xmath169 \n recall that the dataset @xmath72 consists of @xmath170 data points and assume that the number of data points in the neighborhood of @xmath16 is @xmath30 . \n the covariance matrix of a data point @xmath57 from eq . \n [ eq : cov xj ] is also computed once for each data point in @xmath72 , considering each of its @xmath30 neighbors . \n the complexity of the neighborhood computation is @xmath171 operations . \n then , the covariance matrix is computed in @xmath172 operations . \n thus , the complexity of this pre - computation stage is @xmath173 operations . for each data point , we multiply vectors of size @xmath174 by matrices of size @xmath175 or @xmath176 . thus , the out - of - sample extension complexity is @xmath177 operations . \n the function @xmath178 \\times [ 0,\\pi ] \\rightarrow \\mathbbm{r}^3 $ ] maps the spherical coordinates @xmath179 into a 3-d sphere of radius @xmath180 . \n more specifically , @xmath181 we generate @xmath182 data points angularly equally distributed where we have @xmath183 data points on each axis as a training dataset . \n we generate 100 random data points for which we compute the out - of - sample extension . \n the results from the application of the algorithm using weights as defined in eq . \n [ eq : simple w ] , are shown in fig .

application of the second law of thermodynamics to the problem of viscous flow , for which it permits the inference that the two viscosity coefficients must be positive without need to resort to microscopic expressions for the latter  @xcite .    in this work \n we use the generalization of the second law of thermodynamics holding in the presence of black holes ( the generalized second law  gsl ) to reach further conclusions about the shear viscosity coefficient of an arbitrary fluid . \n we do this by describing a new paradox for ideal fluid flow in the presence of a black hole . \n this indicates that the correlation length of a real fluid can not be arbitrarily small . by implication the energy - momentum tensors \n describing systems which display macroscopic fluid behavior must be subject to a restriction : the shear viscosity , a function of the thermodynamic state of the system , can not be arbitrarily small . \n thereby the gsl opens an alternative macroscopic approach to the recently proposed lower bound on viscosity  @xcite . \n the gsl is a unique law of physics that bridges thermodynamics and gravity . \n it is rooted in the understanding that a black hole , basically a pure gravity entity , is endowed with well defined entropy  @xcite proportional to its surface area . \n the gsl  @xcite then claims that the sum of the entropy of all black holes and the total ordinary entropy in the black holes exterior never decreases . \n while this formulation is reminiscent of the ordinary second law , the gsl is exceptional in that it relates ordinary entropy  a rather elusive object from the mechanical viewpoint  and the surface area of the black hole ( formally the area of its horizon ) whose evolution is quite mechanical in nature . from this point of view \n it is little surprise that the gsl has provided unexpected information on entropy . \n an example is the upper bound on the entropy of weakly self - gravitating thermodynamic systems ( the universal bound on entropy  ube  @xcite ) . \n while in particular cases the bound can be verified directly , it is the gsl which really makes understanding of the bound in generic situations easy . \n however , the gsl gives more than just a simpler way to see some results derivable by other means . at the microscopic level the gsl represents a piece of the yet to be established theory of quantum gravity . \n in particular , this law permits , in principle , to draw conclusions that from the microscopic viewpoint would only be derivable from a fundamental theory combining quantum mechanics with gravity . \n for example , the gsl gives an indication of the number of particle species in nature  @xcite . \n in another example , the gsl reveals an _ a priori _ bound on the strength of the electromagnetic interaction  @xcite . \n let us now describe the ideal fluid paradox revealed by invoking the gsl . \n we assume the existence of physical fluids with arbitrarily small shear viscosity @xmath0 at fixed values of some two thermodynamic variables , say the entropy and the energy densities , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . \n ( in this work we consider only simple fluids , so the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 completely determine the thermodynamic state of the system . ) here  physical \" means , among other things , that the fluid satisfies the gsl ; this could , in principle , be checked by considering the fluid at the microscopic level , but we shall not go into such detail . \n the assumption that the fluid has arbitrarily small viscosity allows us to describe its flow as ideal fluid flow , possibly with shocks ( the zero viscosity limit of a given flow can be non - trivial ; see refs . \n it turns out , as we shall show , that for sufficiently slow accretion of the fluid onto the black hole the overall entropy decreases and the gsl is violated . \n the realizability , in principle , of such slow accretion flows will be demonstrated , so that the small viscosity assumption engenders a paradox .    of course \n , ideal fluid paradoxa exist already in non - relativistic physics , for example , the famous dalembert paradox . \n this maintains that an ideal fluid with no boundaries exerts no force whatsoever on a body moving through it with constant velocity . \n in particular , there is no lift force , so swimming or flying would be impossible in such a fluid . \n thus the established fact that swimming is possible in any fluid implies that every real fluid must have nonzero viscosity . \n there is however an essential difference between the dalembert paradox and the paradox described in this work . \n dalembert s paradox says nothing about the actual magnitude of @xmath0 . in contrast , our paradox implies , as we shall see , the existence of a lower bound on @xmath0 for given @xmath1 and @xmath2 . \n this conclusion is in concord with the recent ingenious conjecture of kovtun , starinets and son ( kss )   @xcite ( see also ref . \n @xcite ) . based on holographic calculations of the viscosity coefficient for certain \n strongly coupled quantum field theories with gravity duals , they suggested that the viscosity @xmath0 of a general , possibly non - relativistic , fluid is subject to the universal restriction @xmath3 currently this bound is considered a conjecture well supported for a certain class of field theories  see the detailed discussion in ref . \n @xcite and the references therein . in the sequel \n we discuss the relation between the ideal fluid paradox presented in the next section and the kss bound . \n we also argue that a frequent objection to the validity of the kss bound is likely to be ruled out by the gsl . \n our paper is structured as follows . in sec . \n [ paradx ] we show explicitly that the slow accretion of a truly ideal fluid onto a schwarzschild black hole leads to a contradiction with the gsl . \n one escapes from the paradox by recognizing that every fluid must have a nonvanishing correlation length which restricts the range of applicability of the ideal fluid paradigm . in sec . \n [ kssp ] we obtain a lower bound on the correlation length and a generic estimate of the viscosity of real fluids , which together bound the viscosity to entropy density ratio from below . although this is not yet the kss bound , we consider there the connection between it and the ube , and argue that the gsl provides a natural frame for elucidation of the origin of the former . in the sec . \n [ summary ] we summarize our results and arguments . \n the realizability , in principle , of the slow accretion flow assumed in sec . \n [ paradx ] is demonstrated in the appendix .    unless otherwise stated , we work in units with @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is speed of light and @xmath6 is boltzmann s constant . \n our metric signature is @xmath7 . \n in the present section we consider ideal fluid flow into a spherical black hole . for some flows , \n we demonstrate that it is possible for the gsl to be violated so that the total entropy of the system decreases . \n it follows that the assumption of a perfect continuum down to an arbitrarily small scale is not consistent with the gsl . \n consider a flow , not necessarily spherically symmetric , in which fluid is absorbed by the black hole . \n the rate of change of the total entropy @xmath8 of the system is the sum of the rate of change of the entropy of the black hole exterior , @xmath9 , and that of the black hole entropy @xmath10 : @xmath11 here and below we use schwarzschild coordinates @xmath12 , with @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the schwarzschild radius . \n we first calculate @xmath15 . \n let the fluid s proper entropy density be @xmath1 . \n since the fluid is assumed ideal , there is no dissipative contribution to the entropy current density which is thus purely convective , and must take the form @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the fluid four - velocity . \n the fluid can carry entropy into the hole leading to a decrease of @xmath9 . \n the explicit expression for this comes from the entropy balance equation  @xcite , @xmath18 where @xmath19 stands for the determinant of the schwarzschild metric @xmath20 . \n @xmath15 of the black hole exterior ( @xmath21 ) is thus @xmath22 we have not included a contribution from the outer boundary of the domain of integration because we intend to specialize to stationary flows . in any such situation the entropy flow into the hole per unit @xmath23-time is given by the r.h.s . of eq . \n ( [ exterior ] ) . \n the expression is non - positive because @xmath24 for infalling matter . \n we have assumed that the flow is differentiable , and that it contains no shocks ; otherwise there exists an additional contribution to @xmath15 associated with the entropy generation in the shocks  @xcite . \n let us now consider the second term of the r.h.s . in eq . \n ( [ total ] ) . \n the absorption of the fluid by the black hole increases the latter s mass @xmath25 , producing an increase in the black hole entropy given through energy conservation by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the black hole temperature , and @xmath25 is its mass . \n we shall now write down the flux of energy into the black hole . \n let @xmath28 be the killing vector associated with the stationarity of the black hole . \n then the energy - momentum tensor of the fluid , @xmath29 , must obey @xmath30 or equivalently @xmath31 since @xmath32 is _ minus _ the energy density of the fluid , @xmath33    the energy - momentum tensor of the ideal fluid is given by @xmath34 where @xmath2 is the energy density and @xmath35 is the pressure in the comoving frame . \n consider now the normalization condition @xmath36 , written as @xmath37.\\ ] ] since @xmath38 and @xmath39 are physical velocity components , they should be bounded at @xmath40 . \n hence since @xmath41 is future and inwardly pointed , and @xmath42 as @xmath43 , we can infer from the last equation that @xmath44 at the horizon . combining all the above we find @xmath45 thus @xmath46 in harmony with hawking s area theorem  @xcite . \n we observe from eqs . \n ( [ exterior ] ) and  ( [ black ] ) that while the ( negative ) rate of change of @xmath9 is proportional to the first power of @xmath47 , the ( positive ) rate of change of the black hole entropy is proportional to the _ second _ power of @xmath47 . \n thus for sufficiently small @xmath48 , the total entropy of the system will _ decrease _ , in violation of the gsl . \n explicitly we have @xmath49,\\ ] ] where we stress that at the horizon @xmath47 is never positive . \n we observe that when the accretion velocity @xmath50 ( the suitable mean value of @xmath51 over the horizon ) obeys @xmath52 the total entropy decreases and the gsl is broken . \n we now proceed to search for such flows . \n we first reconsider known explicit solutions . \n the above formulae apply for a generic , not necessarily spherically symmetric , accretion flow onto the black hole ; in particular it may have non - vanishing @xmath53 and @xmath54 . as an example , consider the well known bondi flow ( see ref . \n @xcite and references therein ) . \n bondi flow starts from rest at infinity and is spherically symmetric . for a polytropic equation of state , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the adiabatic exponent , \n the accretion velocity is given by @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 for @xmath60 @xcite . \n it follows that bondi flow will obey the gsl if the following condition holds : @xmath61 we have used the usual expression @xmath62 for the schwarzschild black hole . \n the above conditions would seem to obtain for any fluid with positive pressure thanks to the ube  @xcite . \n this bound states that the entropy @xmath63 of a generic , weakly self - gravitating , thermodynamic system satisfies @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the body s total energy , while @xmath66 is its linear size . \n our experience is that the inequality here is usually a strong one . \n now the minimal size of a parcel of fluid consistent with the fluid description is its correlation length @xmath67 . for a gas , @xmath67 is the mean free path , while for a liquid it is typically the intermolecular distance . \n applied to such a parcel the ube tells us that ( see the next section for more details ) @xmath68 where we have passed from the total entropy and energy to their densities by dividing by the parcel s proper volume . \n again , this bound will in most cases be a strong inequality . \n since the continuum description down to accretion at the black hole makes sense only if @xmath69 , we may conclude that the inequalities  ( [ bondi ] ) will always hold with at least one order of magnitude difference between the r.h.s . and the l.h.s . of the equations \n in the above argument we have tacitly assumed that @xmath70 . \n negative pressure is often discussed in cosmology ( dark energy ) ; the functioning of the gsl in the face of dark energy is fraught with subtleties  @xcite . \n thus bondi flow satisfies the gsl by virtue of the ube . \n clearly , this happens because the accretion velocity approaches the speed of light , @xmath71 . \n we now turn to examples of slow ideal fluid accretion flows that do violate the gsl . \n it is clear from the previous analysis that the gsl holds for any accretion flow of ideal fluid with @xmath71 . \n we expect such flows whenever spherical accretion starts from a distance @xmath72 from the black hole large compared to @xmath14 ( for bondi flow @xmath73 ) . \n but what is @xmath50 in the limit @xmath74 ? \n we now show that @xmath50 vanishes in that limit , thereby giving an example of ideal fluid flow that violates the gsl . \n we study steady , spherically symmetric accretion flow which starts at @xmath75 with the initial flow and sound velocities , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , specified there . \n we assume that the relevant initial conditions are physically realizable ; see the appendix for the discussion of this assumption . \n following ref . \n @xcite we introduce @xmath78 . \n the continuity and the euler equations can be written as @xmath79 where a prime denotes @xmath80 , @xmath81 is the baryon number density , and @xmath82,\\\\ & & d_2=\\frac{2u^2/r - m / r^2}{u},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath83 the local sound velocity . \n obviously @xmath84 is always positive due to the causality constraint @xmath85 ( sound velocity is smaller than velocity of light )  @xcite . \n here we consider only flows with @xmath86 so @xmath87 at the horizon \n .    in bondi flow @xmath88 becomes negative at large @xmath89 which signifies that there exists the so - called sonic radius @xmath90 such that @xmath91 . as is clear from eqs . \n ( [ derivs ] ) , where @xmath88 stands in the denominator , the sonic radius is a special though regular point of the bondi flow , which in other situations could signify the presence a shock . \n by contrast , here we shall choose a range of initial parameters for the flow which ensure that @xmath92 , so that there is no sonic point . \n we assume initial parameters for the flow satisfying @xmath93 it is easy to see from eq . \n ( [ d ] ) that @xmath94 is indeed positive . \n we do not need to derive the explicit form of the flow in order to find @xmath50 . \n it suffices to consider the conservation of the bernoulli integral along the streamlines . \n the relativistic version of the bernoulli equation reads  @xcite @xmath95 assuming for simplicity the polytropic equation of state  ( [ poly ] ) one finds the following relation @xcite @xmath96,\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is the baryon mass . \n the above relation allows us to rewrite the bernoulli equation as @xmath98 evaluating the above equation first at @xmath40 and then at @xmath75 , equating the results , using inequalities  ( [ in1])-([in2 ] ) and assuming that at the horizon @xmath99 remains much smaller than unity ( which we have verified numerically ) , we find that @xmath100 where the ellipsis stands for subleading terms . \n the above expression holds for any @xmath101 and @xmath56 , the latter assumed to be not too close to unity .    actually , the use of the polytropic equation is not essential . \n using eq . \n ( [ bern ] ) directly we would find @xmath102}{n(r_i)\\left[\\rho(r_h)+p(r_h)\\right ] } \\sqrt{1-\\frac{2m}{r_i}}.\\ ] ] if we may assume that there are no abrupt changes in @xmath103 throughout the flow , we recover a result of form eq . \n ( [ accrvel ] ) . we may conclude that an ideal fluid accretion flow which starts close to the horizon with initial parameters complying with inequalities  ( [ in1])-([in2 ] ) can have arbitrarily small @xmath50 . according to the criterion  ( [ ineq0 ] ) \n it will thus incur a violation of the gsl .    of course for the above argument to be convincing \n , we must still demonstrate that it is possible for a flow to start near the horizon with sufficiently small velocity ( and sound speed ) . in the appendix \n we show in detail that a cord which respects fundamental physical constraints can be used to bring objects to rest arbitrarily near the horizon . \n one can envision the setting up of the initial conditions for the fluid we require at @xmath75 by this means . \n the above violation of the gsl raises a paradox . in the real world \n the gsl can not be violated . \n this law has been shown to follow from fundamental concepts in quantum theory and classical gravity  @xcite . \n can the paradox be removed without calling on new physics just for the occasion ? \n an obvious solution would be to call on hawking s radiance to generate entropy that would at least compensate for the decrement of total entropy pointed out in sec . \n [ paradox ] . after all , in free hawking emission the thermal radiation entropy creation rate exceeds the associated rate of decrease of the black hole entropy  @xcite . \n but there exist reasons to reject this as the resolution of our problem . \n the hawking radiation is capable of preventing a violation of the gsl that would arise if high entropy radiation of the same nature , i.e. , electromagnetic , were injected into a black hole with @xmath104 above the effective radiation temperature  @xcite . \n its efficacy here is related to the principle of detailed balance in equilibrium ( in fact , for incoming thermal radiation at temperature @xmath104 the hawking radiation exactly balances the entropy decrement ) . \n now detailed balance refers to modes of the same physical system . \n there is no detailed balance between radiation and fluid modes . \n thus if entropic radiation were injected alongside the fluid accretion , the hawking radiation might prove incapable of compensating for the entropy decreases of the two kinds . \n the above discussion also suggests we should look for a way out of the paradox that hinges on the physics of the fluid itself . in our discussion in sec . \n [ paradox ] we assume that one can deposit the fluid at an arbitrarily small distance from the horizon at an arbitrary velocity . since the physical paradigm used is that of fluids , one should , as a matter of principle , demand that the said distance is still larger than the correlation length @xmath67 at which the hydrodynamic description first becomes applicable \n .    to be in the schwarzschild spacetime a small proper length @xmath105 away from the horizon at @xmath106 corresponds to the schwarzschild coordinate @xmath107 ; here @xmath108 and is given explicitly by @xmath109 let us thus substitute @xmath110 for @xmath72 in our expression  ( [ accrvel ] ) : latexmath:[\\[\\label{u }    correlation length limits the smallness of the accretion velocity @xmath50 . \n with eq . \n ( [ u ] ) the expression in square brackets in eq . \n ( [ entr2 ] ) takes the form @xmath112\\,,\\ ] ] where we used the expression for the black hole temperature . in order for \n the gsl to be obeyed the above factor must be nonpositive . \n this is actually guaranteed by the fluid version of the ube , eq . \n ( [ bekensteinforfluid ] ) , as long as the pressure @xmath35 is nonnegative ( see the next section for more details ) . \n this removes the paradox . \n the moral of the discussion is that a paradox arises if one relies on the continuum description of a fluid down to an arbitrarily small scale , that is if one takes the notion of ideal fluid literally . to be rid of paradoxa one must take cognizance of the finite correlation length of any physical fluid , _ and _ \n must accept that the entropy capacity of fluid matter is limited according to bound  ( [ bekensteinforfluid ] ) . \n the paradox uncovered in sec . \n [ paradox ] and its resolution in sec . \n [ remove ] clearly show that the ideal fluid paradigm is inconsistent . \n in particular , the picture of a fluid as a perfect continuum is shown to be physically unacceptable : the fluid in question must have a nonvanishing correlation length . the medium is a fluid only over scales exceeding the correlation length . \n it turns out that finiteness of the correlation length is incompatible with the vanishing of various transport coefficients like shear viscosity and heat conductivity , another feature of the ideal fluid paradigm . for a gas \n there is a simple way to see this . \n the usual estimates of the mentioned transport coefficients  @xcite have them proportional to the mean free path of the gas molecules . \n but in a gas the mean free path and correlation length are the same thing . \n thus the finite correlation length forces the transport coefficients of the gas , in particular the shear viscosity , to be nonvanishing . \n we shall see in the sequel that the same conclusion applies generally to any liquid as well . \n thus a fluid can be fully compatible with the gsl only if it is dissipative to some extent ( and thus not ideal ) . \n another way of putting this is that a fluid with arbitrarily small shear viscosity is unphysical . \n how large must the correlation length @xmath67 be ? microscopically speaking it must obviously be at least as large as the intermolecular distance . \n but can we say something without delving into the structure of the fluid ? \n let us approach this question in the spirit of wilson s work on the renormalization group  @xcite . \n we consider some thermodynamic system with the typical linear size @xmath113 . \n because the system is macroscopic ( by definition ) , one can represent any extensive thermodynamic variable as some quantity times the system s volume @xmath114 . \n for example , one can write the entropy as @xmath115 and the energy as @xmath116 . now decrease @xmath113 . for sufficiently small @xmath113 , \n already comparable with the system correlation length @xmath67 , the system ceases to be macroscopic , and extensivity is generally lost . \n this means that the expressions for the entropy and energy densities themselves become dependent on @xmath113 . \n the system is no longer a continuum . \n can one set a lower bound on the correlation radius @xmath67 purely from macroscopic considerations ? \n the standard answer to the above question would be in the negative . \n but , surprisingly , the true answer is yes . \n as we have seen , for a macroscopic system the ube can be restated in the form  ( [ bekensteinforfluid ] ) , which immediately leads to the inequality @xmath117 the main point here is that a macroscopic system with size much smaller than @xmath118 would violate the ube ; thus the correlation length can not be much smaller . \n we emphasize , again , that @xmath67 may easily be much larger than the minimal scale  ( [ bekenstein11 ] ) . \n the above result answers the following question : given a macroscopic system with given entropy and energy densities , what is its minimal possible correlation length ? \n it shows that macroscopic quantities do  know \" about the minimal correlation length of the system . \n we mentioned earlier that a nonvanishing correlation length @xmath67 ensures that the transport coefficients of a gas ( which are proportional to @xmath67 ) do not vanish . \n for example , for shear viscosity one has the order of magnitude estimate  @xcite @xmath119 where the speed of sound @xmath83 is of the order of molecular speed  @xcite . \n the above estimate together with eq .  ( [ bekenstein11 ] ) give that @xmath120 is subject to the inequality @xmath121    let us show that the estimate  ( [ estimate ] ) , and thus the bound  ( [ new1 ] ) , must hold also for liquids sufficiently far from a critical point . in this preliminary treatment we neglect heat conductivity and bulk viscosity . \n we note that , for any fluid , density perturbations at scale much larger than @xmath67 generate sound waves . on the other hand , perturbations with scale much smaller than @xmath67 \n are not coherent and produce no sound . \n furthermore , one can still use hydrodynamics asymptotically to describe the evolution of perturbations with scale @xmath67 . \n then the demand that there is no well - defined sound at smaller scales gives the asymptotic condition that at scale @xmath67 the wave decay time @xmath122 , as found from hydrodynamics  @xcite , should be comparable with the wave period @xmath123 . \n this produces the estimate  ( [ estimate ] ) for liquids . \n alternatively , the results  ( [ estimate])-([new1 ] ) can be recovered by considering a sound wave already propagating through the liquid . \n its fourier components with reduced wavelengths near or below @xmath67 should decay over a distance comparable to @xmath67 since we can not have macroscopic flow at those smaller scales . \n now from the _ macroscopic _ point of view , the decay must be caused by transport processes controlled by the viscosities or heat conductivity . according to fluid theory  @xcite , a sound wave of wavelength @xmath124 penetrates a distance of order @xmath125 into the liquid before damping out . according to the above argument , for @xmath126 this penetration length should be @xmath67 , which gives eq . \n ( [ estimate ] ) again .    for relativistic fluids the above consideration should be modified slightly . here \n the wave decay time includes @xmath127 instead of @xmath2 @xcite , which leads to @xmath128 for most realistic fluids @xmath129 , see @xcite , and @xmath130 , so this modification is not essential for the order of magnitude estimate of @xmath0 , see the next subsection for an example . \n the above estimates , however , must fail sufficiently close to a critical point . \n both @xmath0 and @xmath67 diverge at the critical temperature with the power law @xmath131 holding in the vicinity of the critical point . here \n @xmath132 is much less than @xmath133  @xcite . \n this is incompatible with eq . \n ( [ estimate ] ) because both @xmath2 and @xmath83 are finite at the critical point . \n the reason for the failure of the estimate is complications in the asymptotic matching procedure above , related to the difference of the critical exponents of the various quantities involved . \n another issue is that near a critical point the static correlation length @xmath67 becomes different from the scale beyond which hydrodynamics applies .     of experimental viscosities of eleven pure liquids ( data taken mostly from ref . \n @xcite ) vs log@xmath134 of the estimates from eq . \n ( [ estimate ] ) with @xmath67 identified with the average intermolecular separation . both viscosities and estimates \n are in si units ( mpa s ) . \n nonstandard symbols are `` m '' for methane , `` p '' for propane , `` a '' for acetone , `` e '' for ethanol , `` u '' for undecane ( c@xmath135h@xmath136 ) , `` ni '' for nitrobenzene ( phenil - no@xmath137 ) and `` g '' for glycerol ( c@xmath138h@xmath139o@xmath138 ) . a repeated symbol correspond to viscosities at several pressures and temperatures . the solid line is the locus of @xmath140 ; the dotted lines demarcate the region where the viscosity lies within a factor of 3 of @xmath141 . ] \n nevertheless , sufficiently far from the critical point the estimate  ( [ estimate ] ) seems to produce remarkably good results , as shown by fig . \n [ fig : fig1 ] for a number of pure liquids . \n ( the only resounding failure is glycerol , one of the most viscous fluids known . \n the problem with it may be that @xmath67 is much larger than the intermolecular separation , which we routinely used as estimator for @xmath67 . ) \n this fact is remarkable because it allows to reach conclusions on the magnitude of viscosity \n quite possibly of practical value  even for liquids for which no microscopic theory is available . \n let us now turn to the lower bound on the viscosity - entropy density ratio  ( [ new1 ] ) . \n it evidently holds if the estimate  ( [ estimate ] ) works . \n note that eq . \n ( [ new1 ] ) will most often be a strong inequality , particularly for nonrelativistic systems , for which the ube is known to be a very liberal bound . \n thus the bound  ( [ new1 ] ) is generally valid far from a critical point . on the other hand , near the critical point \n the bound  ( [ new1 ] ) holds trivially because its l.h.s . \n diverges while its r.h.s . remains finite . \n thus the divergence of shear viscosity at the critical point  @xcite only strengthens the bound .    the considerations in this subsection \n provide a strong argument in favor of the existence of a generic lower bound on the viscosity - entropy density ratio . \n the reformulation of the arguments with regard to the other transport coefficients , including thermal conductivity , is left for future work . \n it was the challenge presented by the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) which motivated the activity leading to the formulation of the kss bound . \n as a practical use of our estimate  ( [ estimate ] ) , let us apply it to the qgp . \n quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) predicts the existence of such a form of matter where the usually confined quarks and gluons are essentially free forming a fireball with a typical size @xmath142 fm . \n the transition from the hadronic state of matter to the qgp occurs at densities of @xmath143 gev/@xmath144 . \n qcd lattice calculations predict that the transition should take place at a critical temperature @xmath145 mev , and that the speed of sound for a qgp above @xmath146 mev is about @xmath147 ( see ref . \n @xcite and further references therein ) . \n measurements on the qgp at brookhaven s relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) indicate that the ratio of energy density @xmath148 to entropy density @xmath1 is roughly proportional to the qgp temperature @xmath149 ( see , e.g. , fig . 3 in ref . \n specifically , for the high energy results of rhic one has @xmath150 using this and estimate  ( [ estimate ] ) we have @xmath151 where in the last step we assumed @xmath147 at @xmath152 mev , @xmath153 fm corresponding to a number density @xmath154 /@xmath144 , and employed @xmath155 mev fm . \n our estimate for the qgp viscosity is thus in harmony with the kss bound  ( [ kss ] ) . \n moreover , it is in quite reasonable agreement with the experimental data which require a shear viscosity to entropy density ratio as low as @xmath156 @xcite . \n we draw attention to the similarity between inequality  ( [ new1 ] ) with @xmath5 and @xmath157 restored , namely @xmath158 and the conjectured kss bound  ( [ kss ] ) . at first sight \n this inequality seems to fall well below the kss bound since in many cases @xmath159 . \n however , we must keep in mind that , especially in such nonrelativistic circumstances , we expect the inequality to be a strong one . \n the minimum @xmath120 may thus be well above the literal bound  ( [ new2 ] ) , and not necessarily at variance with eq . \n ( [ kss ] ) . for relativistic media @xmath160 , and there is no difference to speak of between bounds  ( [ kss ] ) and  ( [ new2 ] ) . \n thus arguments based on the ube , and ultimately on the gsl , seem to suggest a _ \n raison dtre _ for the mysterious kss bound .    before \n proceeding we wish to provide an alternative viewpoint . \n the kss bound eq . \n ( [ kss ] ) is usually interpreted as saying that a fluid can not be too perfect . \n however , in the form @xmath161 the bound is really an entropy bound , specifically an upper bound on the entropy density of an arbitrary fluid ( we return to the use of units with @xmath162 as in the previous sections ) . \n clearly the above bound is reminiscent of the ube , eq . \n ( [ bekensteinentropy ] ) , and its fluids version , eq . \n ( [ bekensteinforfluid ] ) . \n but at least for non - relativistic fluids , the kss bound is a tighter entropy bound by orders of magnitude than the ube . restoring the speed of light @xmath5 we introduce the variable @xmath163 ( @xmath67 being , again , the correlation length , either the mean free path for a gas , or , typically , the intermolecular separation for a liquid ) which has the dimensions of viscosity . \n thus eq . \n ( [ bekensteinforfluid ] ) gives @xmath164 . using the estimate  ( [ estimate ] ) we have @xmath165 . \n it follows that for nonrelativistic fluids eq . \n ( [ kssentropy ] ) is indeed a much tighter entropy bound than eq . \n ( [ bekensteinforfluid ] ) . \n thus the kss bound can be viewed as a tightened version of the ube in guise of eq . \n ( [ bekensteinforfluid ] ) which is available for the class of systems exhibiting macroscopic fluid behavior .    both the ideal fluid paradox of sec .  [ paradox ] and the interpretation of the kss bound as an entropy bound for fluids suggest the gsl as a natural frame for investigating relations between entropy bounds . \n because the ube is obtained in the most transparent way via the gsl , one may hope that the kss bound should likewise be obtainable most simply with help of the gsl . \n we turn now to considerations in this direction . \n first we remark that it is not clear how to obtain the kss bound directly from microscopic physics . \n inspection of the green - kubo formula  @xcite for the viscosity in terms of fluctuations shows no apparent connection of the viscosity and the entropy . \n such consideration affords no special status to the ratio @xmath120 , at least not from the viewpoint of nongravitational physics . \n on the other hand , the kss conjecture emerged from holographic type arguments that connect quantum field theory with gravity . \n it might thus turn out that a derivation of the kss bound requires use of the still nonexistent theory of quantum gravity . \n but even if this were true , one need not loose heart . \n there is general agreement that black hole entropy , and the gsl which hinges on it , reflect some aspect of quantum gravity . \n the kss is not universally accepted . \n many objections to it rely on scenarios where very many particle species are supposed to exist in nature ( see ref . \n @xcite for an example and references ) . \n these are the same objections raised against the validity of the ube ( see ref . \n @xcite for references ) . \n in fact , any entropy bound whatsoever invites attacks of this sort , for if the number of species that may show up is unlimited , the entropy can be made as large as desired while keeping parameters like energy or total particle number fixed . \n although it is formally true that with many species available , the kss bound must fail , this does not detract from its heuristic usefulness ; one is often interested on the entropy of a specific system , one whose particle content is fixed ahead of time . \n it should also be mentioned that many particle scenarios , if not arbitrarily legislating particle proliferation , conjure up fine - tuned or baroque setups to beget the required large number of species of quasiparticles or excitations . \n this aspect considerably decreases the appeal of the species proliferation arguments . \n both of the above considerations make it clear that a ground up approach to deriving the kss bound is unlikely to succeed . \n alternative , indirect approaches are needed . a point in favor of employing the gsl to investigate the origin of the kss bound \n is that the gsl  knows \" the actual number of species in nature  @xcite . \n for example , black hole entropy , which plays a crucial role in the gsl , should in principle depend on the number of elementary fields , yet all derivations endow it with a fixed coefficient which may be thought as determined by the actual number of species . \n this feature would act to neutralize the above mentioned argument against the validity of the kss bounds . \n we have worked out the expression for the rate of change of the total entropy of a system consisting of a schwarzschild black hole and ideal fluid which can accrete onto the hole . \n the well known bondi flow is the case of fast accretion with velocity near to the speed of light ; for it the gsl is always obeyed due to the ube . for sufficiently slow accretion velocity \n the flow violates the gsl . \n the question of whether flow with the required small accretion velocity is a realistic option is answered in the affirmative by a critical revision , in the appendix , of the venerable argument  @xcite claiming that it is impossible to adiabatically lower mass to near the black hole horizon . \n since it is known from microscopic considerations  @xcite that any physical system should comply with the gsl , the above result would constitute a serious paradox if the ideal fluid is a continuum , as usually considered . \n we find , however , that the paradox can be defused if one takes into account that the continuum picture must break down at some level by virtue of the fluid having a nonvanishing correlation length . \n an auxiliary role in the nullification of the paradox is played by the universal entropy bound . \n it gives a lower bound on the correlation length in relation to the fluid s entropy density . \n the lower bound on the correlation length of an arbitrary thermodynamic system in terms of its ( macroscopic ) entropy and energy densities is an unexpected and thought - provoking aspect of the ube . \n it makes it clear that the gsl , though a macroscopic law , `` knows '' about the microscopic structure of matter . \n the lower bound must rank as one of the most impressive consequences of the extension of the second law of thermodynamics to include black holes . \n the breakdown of the continuum description of a fluid has momentous consequences : discreteness of matter and thermal fluctuations necessarily engender nonideal behavior parameterized by the viscosity and heat conduction coefficients . \n we have shown that one can expect the existence of a universal lower bound on the viscosity of an arbitrary fluid . \n our argument yields a seemingly novel estimate for the viscosity of a fluid far from the critical region ; this estimate is shown to be better than an order of magnitude estimate for a range of pure liquids . \n in addition , the estimate works reasonably well for the quark - gluon plasma , which viscosity was a subject of much study lately @xcite . \n together with the lower bound on the correlation length , the viscosity estimate yields a lower bound on viscosity per unit entropy density which may be expressed in terms of the sound velocity of the fluid . \n the appearance of the speed of sound here , in contrast to the ( implicit ) speed of light in the original kss arguments , may signify that the kss argument can be improved , or may perhaps disclose that the field theories considered by kss as representatives of strongly coupled fluids are not sufficiently generic  in all these theories the sound velocity is comparable with the speed of light . \n an additional issue is whether the bound can be extended to other transport coefficients . \n if there is indeed a lower bound on the ratio of viscosity to entropy density for an arbitrary fluid , then it is likely to be rooted in some very basic principle of physics . \n we have shown that the generalized second law of thermodynamics , combining as it does gravity with thermodynamics , can be such a principle . \n starting from it , one can anticipate that the viscosity to entropy ratio of an arbitrary fluid obeys a certain lower bound . \n in particular , the gsl incorporates physics that weakens the recent objections  @xcite to the bound s very existence . on the basis of the above \n , we propose that the use of the gsl may lead to a clarification of the kss bound s origin . \n although we have made no concrete progress towards reaching a final sharp inequality , we have given for the first time physical arguments indicating that this elusive bound , whose existence is sometimes disputed , indeed exists . \n i. f. thanks v. lebedev for an illuminating discussion . \n g. b. thanks the hebrew university for a golda meir fellowship . \n j. d. b.s research is supported by grant 694/04 of the israel science foundation , established by the israel academy of sciences . \n gibbons  @xcite claimed that one can not lower a rope to near a black hole at an arbitrarily small velocity , without it being torn at some finite distance from the horizon . \n the conclusion was based upon the assertion that the stresses that arise in the rope become so strong that they violate the weak energy condition @xcite which must be obeyed by the energy - momentum tensor of physical matter . here \n we reexamine the problem and show that , in fact , the energy condition need not be violated and thus that adiabatic lowering down to the horizon is , in principle , possible .    in the stationary state of some matter in the vicinity of a spherical black hole , \n the energy momentum tensor obeys @xmath166 where we used the symmetry of @xmath167  @xcite . \n below we concentrate on configurations for which @xmath168 is diagonal . using the same coordinates as in sec . \n [ balance ] , the @xmath169 component of the above equations is satisfied automatically , while the radial component gives @xmath170    the above equation gives a linear relation between the different components of the stress tensor which need not , _ a priori _ , respect the weak energy condition . as an example , consider a thin spherical shell in equilibrium . for the shell \n the contribution of @xmath171 in the above equation is negligible . \n this can be seen by noting that @xmath171 vanishes at the shell boundaries , and as a result its values within the shell vanish together with the ratio of shell thickness to radius . far from the hole , where the shell is describable by the classical linear elasticity theory , \n the maximal value of @xmath171 is found to be proportional to the square of the above ratio . \n so the thin shell is basically supported by the tangential stresses @xmath172 and @xmath173 , which must be equal because of spherical symmetry . \n ( [ radial ] ) gives @xmath174 . \n now the weak energy condition would demand @xmath175 . \n it is thus clear that a stationary thin shell would violate the condition at @xmath176 . \n thus a physical thin shell , i.e. one obeying the energy condition , can not support itself arbitrarily close to the horizon ( see ref . \n @xcite for the more detailed discussion ) .    ref . \n @xcite argued that the rope can not be in equilibrium with its lower end arbitrarily close to the black hole , similarly to the thin shell above . here \n we wish to correct this conclusion . \n we shall assume that the rope fibers can be considered radial , such as in the case of a conical rope filling the portion of space defined by some solid angle . \n since the rope can only support stresses along its fibers , the general form of its energy - momentum tensor is @xmath177 $ ] , and eq .  ( [ radial ] ) gives @xmath178    the above linear equation can be used to express the stress @xmath179 in terms of the rope density @xmath2 and the boundary condition at the lower end of the rope , @xmath180 , which is defined by the load . \n the solution can be written as a sum @xmath181 , where @xmath182 describes the stresses caused by the load , while @xmath183 describes the stresses caused by the rope s own weight . \n the expression for @xmath182 ( the solution for a weightless rope ) expresses the `` constancy of the tension '' along the rope : @xmath184 where @xmath185 is determined by the weight of the load ; for a point mass @xmath97 we have @xmath186 . note that @xmath182 is negative , as befitting a tension . \n the `` constancy of the tension '' gives monotonically decreasing @xmath187 as one moves out because the rope cross - section increases with @xmath89 by the assumed symmetry of the fibers . \n the expression for @xmath183 ( the solution without the load ) describes how the force caused by the rope above some @xmath89 balances the weight of the rope below : @xmath188 for definiteness we shall consider below the case of the rope with a constant density @xmath189 where integration gives @xmath190 . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we now show that the above solution does not violate the weak energy condition @xmath191 , and in particular , that no violation occurs even when the rope s end is arbitrarily close to the horizon . by choosing sufficiently large @xmath189 we may always disregard @xmath182 , so it is sufficient to show that @xmath192 . \n it is easy to see from eq . \n ( [ a1 ] ) that the maximum of @xmath193 , at given @xmath189 and @xmath25 , grows as @xmath194 decreases . this just means that the maximal stress is the bigger the closer the lower end of the rope is from the horizon . \n therefore , it is enough to show that @xmath192 for @xmath194 which is infinitesimally close to @xmath106 . in general , \n @xmath195 , vanishing as it is at both endpoints , @xmath180 and @xmath196 , has a unique maximum at @xmath197 . \n it is easy to see numerically that in the limit @xmath198 the point @xmath199 also tends to @xmath14 . \n defining @xmath200 we find analytically @xmath201 where @xmath202 and the dots stand for subleading terms . \n it follows from the above that the weak energy condition is obeyed for any @xmath203 . \n thus , at least from the viewpoint of the energy conditions , it is possible in principle to lower a body adiabatically all the way down to the horizon by means of a suitably constructed rope . \n our result is at variance with that of gibbons  @xcite . \n the discrepancy arises because he missed a term when calculating a certain 4-divergence ( eq . \n ( 5 ) in ref . \n @xcite ) . by taking this term into account , the main result , eq . \n ( 8) in ref . \n @xcite , now reads @xmath204 here @xmath205 is the tension , @xmath206 the rope s cross section , @xmath207 the energy per unit proper length of the rope , and @xmath208 is the norm of the timelike killing field @xmath209 ( the spacetime is taken to be stationary ) . in the original derivation , the term @xmath149 in the denominator of the l.h.s . \n ( [ gibb ] ) is absent . \n the corrected eq . \n ( [ gibb ] ) is indeed in accord with our eq . \n ( [ drs ] ) . observing that in the schwarzschild geometry \n @xmath210 and further @xmath211 for the case of a conical rope , one easily checks that eq . \n ( [ gibb ] ) reduces to our eq . \n ( [ drs ] ) . \n our analysis demonstrates that no problem of principle militates against the creation of the boundary conditions required for the slow accretion flow considered in sec . \n [ paradox ] here . \n a suitably designed rope could be used to deposit parcels of fluid at rest near the horizon . \n j. zhou , b. wang , y. gong , and e. abdalla , preprint , arxiv:0705.1264v2 ; g. izquierdo and d. pavon , phys . \n b * 639 * , 1 ( 2006 ) and preprint arxiv : gr - qc/0612092 ; j. a. de freitas pacheco and j. e. horvath , preprint arxiv:0709.1240 .", "human_aspect": "{\n  \"background\": \"we describe a new paradox for ideal fluids.

mass stars and star clusters . \n millimeter molecular line observations of the nessie nebula were taken on 2008 august with the australia telescope national facility ( atnf ) 22 m mopra telescope . \n the backend consisted of the wideband mops correlator configured to observe simultaneously 16 separate passbands covering the frequency range 86 to 93 ghz . \n each of these passbands was 137.5 mhz wide , with 4096 spectral channels , corresponding to a velocity resolution of 0.11 . \n we chose individual passbands to include molecular lines of interest . \n the brightest of the detected lines was ( 10)(90.66 ghz ) . \n although we detected a number of fainter molecular lines , these yield similar results and will be presented in a subsequent paper . \n the nebula was mapped in the `` on - the - fly '' mode , in which data are collected while the telescope scans in a raster pattern . \n the raster rows were chosen to be perpendicular to the galactic plane in order to avoid striping artifacts parallel to the nebula s long axis . \n the spacing between rows was 12  , or about 1/3 of the mopra beamwidth of 36  fwhm @xcite \n . flux calibration with a noise diode and an ambient temperature load was performed every 20 minutes . \n data reduction and analysis utilized the atnf livedata and gridzilla programs . \n the individual spectra were co -

beam brightness temperatures \n , one should divide the antenna temperatures by the main - beam efficiency of 0.49 @xcite . \n system temperatures for the observations were @xmath12 k , which yielded a typical rms noise of @xmath13 k in each spectral channel . \n the mopra integrated intensity ( 10)maps closely correspond to the regions of mid - ir extinction ( figure [ figure1 ] ) . \n the map consists of fainter , uniform emission associated with the filament , upon which compact , brighter regions we call `` cores '' are superposed . \n gaussian fits to the ( 10)lines demonstrate that every position within nessie has essentially the same radial velocity , @xmath14 @xmath2  ( figure [ figure1 ] ) \n . if the clemens rotation curve is used , this velocity corresponds to a kinematic distance of 3.1 kpc @xcite . \n the molecular cores in nessie are often associated star - formation activity . \n specifically , many cores show the presence of excess 4.5 @xmath15 m emission called `` green fuzzies , '' which indicates shocked gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and bright 24 @xmath15 m point sources , which indicate an embedded protostar ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n the cores do not appear to be randomly spaced within the filament , but instead have a characteristic spacing . \n the filament is thus reminiscent of a string with beads that are spaced sparsely but approximately uniformly along its length . \n we used the clumpfind2d algorithm with a threshold of seven times the rms noise and 2.5@xmath16 increments @xcite on the ( 10)integrated intensity map to identify 12 molecular cores ( see figure [ figure1 ] ) . \n the exact choice of clumpfind parameters will result in the identification of slightly more or fewer cores , but the resulting core spacing is quite insensitive to reasonable input parameters . since the cores are relatively isolated and well separated , clumpfind works well and identifies the cores that one would tend to select by eye . \n the positions and selected properties of the cores are listed in table [ coretable ] . \n columns 1 and 2 give the galactic coordinates of the position of peak integrated hnc intensity in each core , column 3 the peak hnc integrated intensity , columns 4 and 5 the angular size and physical extent , column 6 the lte mass ( see section [ discussion ] ) , and column 7 whether or not the core contains a 24 @xmath15 m point source . the mean projected spacing between cores \n is roughly 4.5 pc . \n although we prefer to use the molecular gas clumps as our indicator of core spacing , since we thereby include pre - stellar cores , another useful indicator of cluster - forming sites would be 24 @xmath15 m point sources , which indicate embedded high - mass stars or protostars . \n indeed , about half of the molecular cores contain 24 @xmath15 m point sources ( see table [ coretable ] ) . \n for all of the unresolved 24 @xmath15 m sources associated with the nebula , we find typical spacing of 4.1 pc , a value within 10% of the molecular core spacing . \n thus , both the spacing of gas clumps and of 24 @xmath15 m sources are in satisfactory agreement . \n the existence of cores that are spaced at approximately a characteristic spacing within a highly filamentary cloud is in broad agreement with the predictions of fragmentation of a self - gravitating fluid cylinder due to the  sausage \" instability . \n the theory s original presentation by @xcite treated an incompressible fluid . \n later refinements included an isothermal , thermally supported cylinder with various magnetic field configurations @xcite . \n although the fragmentation due to the  sausage \" instability of a self - gravitating fluid cylinder is similar to three - dimensional jeans collapse , there are important differences . in spherical gravitational jeans \n collapse , perturbations of all wavenumbers grow at the same rate , but in cylindrical gravitational collapse perturbations with certain wavenumbers grow more quickly than others . perturbations with the most unstable wavenumber will grow fastest , and hence overdensities ( cores ) will tend to form at a length scale whose wavenumber corresponds to this fastest growing mode . for a cylinder of infinite radius , \n this length scale is maintained even in the presence of a magnetic field parallel to the filament s axis @xcite . \n the theory thus predicts ( 1 ) that multiple cores should form within a filament , and ( 2 ) that the spacing between these cores should be roughly periodic , with a characteristic length scale equal to the wavelength of the fastest growing unstable mode of the fluid instability . for an incompressible fluid , this wavelength is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the cylinder s radius @xcite . in an infinite isothermal gas cylinder , \n the relation is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the isothermal scale height given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the sound speed , @xmath23 the gravitational constant , and @xmath24 the gas mass density at the center of the filament ( @xmath25 ) @xcite . for isothermal cylinders of finite radius @xmath18 surrounded by an external , uniform medium , \n the spacing depends on the ratio between the cylinder radius and the isothermal scale height , @xmath26 . for @xmath27 \n the core spacing approaches that for an infinite radius cylinder , @xmath19 , but for @xmath28 the spacing reduces to that of the incompressible case , @xmath17 . \n we now compare the observations of nessie to this theory under the assumption that nessie is well approximated by an isothermal cylinder . \n if nessie lies in the limit @xmath28 , the theory reduces to that of an incompressible fluid , and predicts cores spaced at a characteristic length scale @xmath29 . \n one can estimate the radius @xmath18 of nessie from the radial extent of the sharp extinction edges evident in the glimpse and mipsgal images . \n this suggests a radius of @xmath30 or @xmath31 pc at the kinematic distance of 3.1 kpc @xcite . \n thus , one would expect cores to form at a spacing of @xmath32 pc , in satisfactory agreement with the observations if the filament axis is mostly perpendicular to the line of sight . \n if nessie is treated as an isothermal gas cylinder with a central volume density @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 k , appropriate for cold , dense , molecular gas traced by ( 10)emission , then the isothermal scale height is @xmath36 pc . \n thus , nessie would be in the regime @xmath27 , and the theoretical spacing between cores should be @xmath37 pc . \n this is smaller than the observed spacing by about a factor of 5 . \n this discrepancy may arise from the fact that turbulent pressure dominates over thermal pressure . \n theoretical studies of self - gravitating cylinders usually assume that thermal pressure is the dominant gas pressure . \n however , because the observed linewidths in most molecular clouds typically exceed the thermal sound speeds by large factors , turbulent pressure usually dominates over thermal pressure . \n if one replaces the sound speed @xmath22 with the velocity dispersion @xmath16 to account for turbulent pressure @xcite , the effective scale height @xmath38 is increased considerably over the thermal scale height @xmath20 . \n assuming a central volume density again of @xmath39 @xmath34 , and a fwhm linewidth of 2.5 , typically observed toward nessie , the effective scale height is @xmath40 pc , which leads to a spacing of @xmath41 pc between the cores . \n again , the theoretical prediction is in satisfactory agreement with the observations , especially since the central density and hence the scale height @xmath20 is uncertain . \n moreover , the theoretical assumption of a uniform , isothermal cylinder ( sometimes embedded in a uniform pressure external medium ) is obviously idealized , and the fragmentation length scale may well differ in more realistic treatments . \n the theory also predicts that self - gravitating cylinders in equilibrium have a maximum , critical linear mass density ( mass per unit length along the cylinder s axis ) . above the critical value \n , the cylinder would collapse radially into a line . \n this critical linear mass density is given by @xmath42 ; where @xmath43 is the sound speed @xmath22 in the case of thermal support ( stodolkiewicz 1963 , ostriker 1964 ) and the turbulent velocity dispersion @xmath16 in the case of turbulent support @xcite . \n if turbulent pressure dominates over thermal pressure in nessie , the critical linear mass density can be estimated as @xmath44 @xmath10 @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is in units of . for typical line widths observed in nessie ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 m@xmath49 pc@xmath50 . \n [ note that magnetic fields can alter the critical linear mass density , increasing it for poloidal fields and decreasing it for toroidal fields , but probably by small factors @xmath51 @xcite . ] \n the mass per unit length in the nessie nebula can be estimated from the ( 10)fluxes , although this estimate is difficult due to uncertainties in molecular abundances , depletion of molecules frozen onto cold dust grains , and optical depth effects . nevertheless , assuming optically thin ( 10)emission , lte , a temperature of 10 k , and an hnc abundance of x@xmath52 @xcite appropriate for cold clouds , we arrive at a typical linear mass density in nessie of 110 m@xmath49 pc@xmath50 . because this value is smaller than the maximum predicted by theory , the estimated linear mass density is consistent with theoretical expectations . \n unfortunately , the reported abundances of hnc vary widely , with values for cold clouds ranging from @xmath53 to @xmath54 @xcite . \n these hnc abundance values give rise to a wide range in the linear mass density of up to @xmath55 m@xmath49 pc@xmath50 . \n future observations of the dust continuum will better constrain the linear mass density . \n it is interesting to compare the value of @xmath56 obtained by theory and estimated in nessie with that measured for the molecular filament associated with orion , @xmath57 m@xmath49 pc@xmath50 , assuming m = @xmath58 m@xmath49 and @xmath59 pc @xcite . \n this value is within a factor of a few of that estimated for nessie , and also smaller than the maximum value predicted by theory . \n the maximum mass of the cores can also be estimated from theory . \n the core masses should roughly be given by @xmath60 . \n assuming the maximum , critical value for @xmath56 of @xmath61 m@xmath49 pc@xmath50 for the case of turbulent pressure support , and a spacing of 4.5 pc , one expects the cores to have maximum masses @xmath62 . \n if instead the average linear mass density of 110 m@xmath49 pc@xmath50 derived for nessie is used , the core masses should be no larger than about @xmath63 . \n for nessie , the estimated core masses based on the integrated ( 10)fluxes over the solid angles range from @xmath64 ( table [ coretable ] ) \n .    to summarize , if turbulent pressure , rather than thermal pressure , provides the support for nessie , the core spacing ( 4.5 pc ) agrees with theoretical predictions . \n moreover , both the linear mass density and the core masses in nessie are also consistent with the theory , since they are comparable to , but fall below , the maximum theoretical values . \n we speculate that all cluster formation arises from the fragmentation of filamentary irdcs due to fluid instabilities that lead to massive , star - forming cores . \n the periodic spacing of such cores within nessie strengthens this suggestion . \n moreover , filamentary molecular gas clouds are usually associated with high - mass star - forming regions , such as orion , and these warmer clouds bear a striking resemblance to irdcs . \n such clouds may represent a later evolutionary stage of a filamentary irdc . \n a cartoon sketch of the proposed evolution of irdcs is given in figure [ cartoon ] . \n initially a filamentary irdc is formed . \n the filament reaches an equilibrium configuration with a linear mass density close to the critical value . \n the filament then fragments due to the `` sausage '' instability into roughly periodically spaced cores . \n such dense molecular cores have sufficiently large masses to form clusters . the mass of the cores is set by a combination of the turbulent velocity dispersion , which determines the linear mass density , and the wavelength of the fastest growing mode of the `` sausage '' instability . \n thus , the cluster - forming core mass , and ultimately , the mass of the resulting cluster , is determined by the physics of the turbulent , self - gravitating cylindrical fluid . within the more massive cores , high - mass protostars form . when an embedded o or an early b protostar eventually reaches the main sequence , it ionizes the surrounding gas and creates a bubble in the interstellar medium @xcite . eventually the embedded cluster emerges .    in the earliest phases , then , filamentary irdcs with several cores would be observed . \n as the regions form , bubbles would be associated with the irdcs , and eventually the irdc would be segmented and disrupted as the regions grow and overlap . \n later , the filament would contain one or more bright clusters , and appear similar to the filamentary molecular clouds associated with high - mass star - forming regions such as orion and ngc 6334 @xcite . \n examples of each of these proposed stages can easily be found , from dark filamentary irdcs like g@xmath65 , sometimes called the snake @xcite , to irdcs containing one or more bubble - like regions such as nessie , to active high - mass star - forming regions like orion and ngc 6334 . \n we have imaged a filamentary irdc , the nessie nebula , in ( 10)molecular line emission with the atnf mopra telescope . because the ( 10)radial velocities are uniform across the filament \n , nessie is a coherent , single cloud . \n both ( 10)and mid - ir images reveal that nessie contains numerous dense cores , which appear to have a roughly periodic spacing of 4.5 pc . \n the theory of self - gravitating , gaseous cylinders shows that they are unstable to a fluid instability , called the `` sausage '' instability , which causes the filament to fragment into cores with a roughly constant spacing . \n thus , unlike the jeans collapse of uniform media , the fragmentation of cylinders has a preferred length scale . \n theory predicts that the fastest growing wavelength scales as the radius @xmath18 or the isothermal scale height @xmath20 of the cylinder , depending on the ratio @xmath26 . in the conditions \n thought to be appropriate to nessie , the spacing between clumps is predicted to be 4 to 6 pc , in good agreement with the observed spacing of 4.5 pc .    because of the ubiquity of the association between filamentary molecular clouds and high - mass star forming regions , it is tempting to suggest that the physics of molecular filaments has a profound influence on cluster formation . indeed \n , such filaments may be a necessary initial condition to form dense cluster -

assisted processes , the tunnel amplitude is cast into an infinite sum : @xmath36 which gives : @xmath37 the change of variables @xmath38 with @xmath39 has been operated . \n note that only @xmath40 terms in eq . \n ( [ etaeta1 ] ) contribute to the first integral because of the symmetry properties of the green s function . on the contrary , \n only @xmath41 terms contribute to the second integral because such an integral does not depend on @xmath31 . \n using the expression for the green s function eq.([green ] ) , the current can thus be split into two contributions , with integrants containing either a sine or a cosine of @xmath42 . \n the time integral can be performed analytically and is expressed in terms of the gamma function @xmath43 ( see appendix [ appendixa ] ) . \n grouping the two contributions , we obtain : @xmath44    the fourier transform of the current , @xmath45 , yields : @xmath46    to zero order in the amplitude @xmath47 of the modulation , we recover the i - v characteristics of the pure stationary regime ( @xmath48 ) : @xmath49    expanding the current to first order with @xmath47 corresponds to @xmath50 and @xmath51 or to @xmath52 and @xmath53 : @xmath54~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the limit @xmath55 , eqs . \n ( [ ordre1 ] ) and ( [ ordre2 ] ) lead , at zero and first orders with @xmath47 , to the backscattering current : @xmath56    finally , one can analyze which dc contribution is provided by the ac modulation : the rectification property . \n this information is contained in the zero - frequency fourier transform : @xmath57 which is obtained to all orders in the modulation . also note that it can be re - expressed in terms of the dc current : \n @xmath58 a general relation which was noticed in ref . . \n first , note that the result of eq . \n ( [ real_time_current ] ) seems to blow up at @xmath1 . in this situation , \n the absolute value in the last term of this equation becomes independent of @xmath59 and the term proportional to @xmath60 vanishes at @xmath1 . \n consider now the case of arbitrary @xmath2 . \n for the present result to be valid , one should be consistent with the assumption of weak backscattering , and the differential conductance should thus be much smaller than the conductance quantum @xmath61 associated with the unperturbed fractional edge : @xmath62 first , consider the limit of a weak ac perturbation @xmath63 . in this case , the zero order current given by eq . \n ( [ ordre1 ] ) dominates and , @xmath64 in particular , for @xmath55 , the condition of validity of perturbation theory yields : @xmath65 which is independent of @xmath66 , and which simply states that electron transport along the edge dominates over backscattering contributions .    for laughlin fractions which have @xmath67 \n , the backscattering current diverges at low bias ( the known `` paradox '' of luttinger liquids ) , and the validity condition for a weak ac modulation reads : @xmath68    one can also derive a validity condition if the limit where @xmath69 is arbitrary . \n the starting point is to rewrite eq . \n ( [ real_time_current ] ) by resumming over the integer variable @xmath70 : @xmath71 every time @xmath66 \n approaches @xmath72 , the backscattering current @xmath73 diverges because of the quasiparticle density of states exponent @xmath74 . \n if one treats all these divergences ( for different @xmath59 ) independently , one can derive a _ sufficient _ condition for the validity of eq . \n ( [ real_time_current ] ) : @xmath75 note that this condition looks quite similar to the one derived for the weak ac modulation , except for the shift @xmath72 on the voltage bias .    in the following section , a series of plots ( figs . \n [ fig2]-[fig5 ] ) displays the zero frequency component of the current , the noise and the noise derivative with respect to bias all as a function of the ratio @xmath76 , for various filling factors . \n the divergences on these plots should be understood to be unphysical outside the limits specified by eq . \n ( [ limitation ] ) . outside these limits , \n one expects a crossover to the strong backscattering regime , in analogy with the renormalization group analysis of ref . \n for the stationary situation . \n the symmetrized backscattering current noise correlator is expressed with the help of the keldysh contour : @xmath77 here one is interested in the poissonian limit only , so in the weak backscattering case , one collects the second order contribution in the tunnel barrier amplitude @xmath78 , and the product of the average backscattering current can be dropped . \n the meaning of the poissonian limit is that quasiparticles which tunnel from one edge to another do so in an independent manner . \n yet by doing so they can absorb or emit @xmath59 `` photon '' quanta of @xmath79 ( @xmath59 integer ) . \n ( [ noise_definition ] ) is our definition of the real time correlator , but this choice is not necessarily obvious . \n indeed , it has been pointed out in ref .   that the choice of correlator  symmetrized or non symmetrized  depends on how the noise measurement is performed . \n more recently , ref . has argued that the non \n symmetrized correlator corresponds to what is actually probed at finite frequencies , provided that the detector which is used to measure the noise is set at sufficiently low temperatures . in the dc regime \n however , it is well understood that such differences do not matter , as long as one considers zero frequency noise . in the present work , \n the origin for off - equilibrium phenomena comes from both a dc bias and an ac drive . \n the latter effect breaks time translational invariance , so that the finite frequency noise involves in general two frequencies@xcite : @xmath80 here , one of the main purpose of this work is to analyze the noise when both frequencies @xmath81 and @xmath82 are set to zero , because the presence of the ac perturbation mimics at finite frequency noise measurement . for zero frequencies , \n it is therefore justified to use the symmetrized correlator of eq . \n ( [ noise_definition ] ) . \n the quasiparticle correlators have already been calculated for the backscattering current , therefore in terms of chiral green s functions the real time correlator becomes : @xmath83 the double fourier transform of the real time noise correlator then reads : @xmath84 changing to relative time coordinates @xmath85 and @xmath86 , one obtains two contributions whose time integrals can be factored out , and the time integrals can be performed ( see appendix [ appendixa ] ) : @xmath87 in particular , the case where both frequencies are set to zero can serve as a point of comparison with experiments : @xmath88 note that this quantity is obtained in perturbation theory but it contains _ all _ orders in the harmonic perturbation .    the results are now illustrated and discussed . the quantities which are plotted on figs . \n [ fig2 ] to [ fig6 ] are normalized according to the prefactors which appear on eqs . \n ( [ zerofrequencycurrent ] ) and ( [ zerofrequencynoise ] ) . at @xmath55 , \n one recovers ( fig . \n [ fig2 ] ) the results of ref . . \n the noise derivative with respect to @xmath66 has a step - like behavior , with steps located at @xmath89 , ( @xmath70 integer ) , and the step heights are related to the weight @xmath90 . \n the zero frequency fourier transform of the current does not display any structure at the step locations for the noise : it is simply linear . \n 7 cm    for lower values of the filling factor , electronic correlations modify this behavior drastically . generally speaking , the power law behavior @xmath91 should have a `` stronger '' singularity for lower filling factors . for the fractional quantum hall effect , \n only odd fractions are allowed for @xmath2 . \n the results are illustrated with filling factor @xmath92 , which represents the correlated state which is `` easiest '' to access experimentally@xcite . \n 7 cm    first , one observes that contrary to the free electron case , the zero frequency fourier transform of the current displays singularities every time @xmath76 reaches an integer value ( fig . \n [ fig3 ] ) . \n such singularities reflect the tunneling density of states of the quasiparticles , in a similar manner which is observed in the backscattering current \n voltage characteristics@xcite . \n nevertheless , one should remember that the present calculation is only valid in the weak backscattering regime : the current @xmath93 whose fourier transform is displayed in fig . \n [ fig3 ] , should be much lower than the maximal current along the fractional edge as it is discussed in section [ validity ] . \n next , the noise ( for both frequencies set to zero ) is plotted as a function of bias . while at @xmath55 , the noise was found to be a continuous function of @xmath66 ( with discontinuous derivatives ) , for @xmath92 it displays evenly spaced singularities as for the current ( fig . \n [ fig4 ] ) .    7 cm    note that the spacing between singular points can serve as a diagnosis for the effective charges at play , as in the dc shot noise experiments : recall that the effective charge @xmath4 is implicit in the definition of @xmath66 . \n measured at a given , fixed amplitude for the noise , the peaks widths get reduced as @xmath94 is increased : on the figure it becomes difficult to resolve this width beyond @xmath95 . \n the present results bear strong similarities with the finite frequency noise of ref . \n ( 17 ) ) , which was computed in the absence of an ac bias . \n in fact eq . \n ( [ two_frequencies ] ) contains these previous results . in the absence of the ac bias ( @xmath96 ) \n , only @xmath48 remains in eq . \n ( [ two_frequencies ] ) , giving a dependence @xmath97 . using the definition of the double fourier transform , \n one identifies @xmath81 as the frequency where the noise is computed in ref . . \n indeed , in the absence of an ac bias , time translational invariance is restored and this frequency is the only relevant one , and one gets the same density of states divergences as for the dc , finite frequency noise . \n the interesting feature in the present work is that when one considers the ac driven noise , with both frequencies set to zero , one recovers information on a dc , finite frequency measurement . \n another point of comparison is the ( unphysical ) value @xmath1 : although this filling factor does not correspond to a laughlin fraction , it allows to make a connection with an exact solution using the refermionization procedure @xcite ( sec . \n the backscattering current noise shows no structure : this noise is perfectly flat with respect to the bias voltage because of the tunneling density of states exponents . on the other hand , the zero - frequency current displays steps as a function of @xmath76 ( fig . \n [ fig5 ] ) . here \n , one can make a direct comparison between the zero frequency noise derivative at @xmath55 and the zero fourier transform of the current at @xmath1 : the frequency exponents for both quantities turn out to be the same , and the bessel coefficients which appear in front of these terms are also identical , in eqs . \n ( [ zero_frequency_fourier_current ] ) and ( [ zero_frequency_noise ] ) .    7 cm \n the results of the preceding section can be straightforwardly extended to treat the limit of strong backscattering , by appealing to the duality relation between the weak and strong backscattering limits . \n indeed , the action of a gate voltage separates the fractional quantum hall fluid into two components , between which only electrons can tunnel . the main changes to operate on the preceding results are in the tunneling operator , as the fields now represent normal electrons . \n this corresponds to the substitution : @xmath98 this yields for the electron tunneling current and noise : @xmath99    @xmath100    in particular , for zero frequencies , @xmath101    7 cm    the results are displayed in fig . \n [ fig6 ] . on the one hand \n , one can expect that the photo - assisted shot noise should bear similarities with the free electron case because the charge carriers which tunnel from one quantum hall fluid to the other are electrons . on the other hand \n , the transport occurs between two correlated electron systems with a vanishing tunneling density of states . here \n , we see that the photo - assisted shot noise is a smooth function of @xmath76 . \n this suggests that the strong backscattering regime does not offer any straightforward diagnosis for effective charges as in the weak backscattering case . \n finally , for the sake of completeness , we mention that for fractional quantum hall systems in the strong backscattering regime , super - poissonian noise has been observed in dc shot noise measurements . \n indeed , it has been shown that @xcite at sufficiently low temperatures , the effective charge which tunnels from one quantum hall fluid to the other , as analyzed by the ratio @xmath102 , can be equal to @xmath103 or can be even larger . \n these experiments suggest that the relevant tunneling process involves pairs  or groups  of electrons . from the point of view of our model , this means that one should take into account the tunneling of such pairs , while an inspection of the renormalization group equations tells us that such processes should be less relevant than the bare electron tunneling term . while this topic is still under debate , and has no simple theoretical explanation for the dc shot noise , here can only give a schematic picture of what will happen for the photo - assisted shot noise . in the above \n , one recalls that the vanishing of the density of states for single electron tunneling in a luttinger liquid is the reason why photo - assisted shot noise does not display any sharp features for the strong backscattering regime . \n the density of states for two electron tunneling is expected to vanish with an exponent @xmath104 , i.e. much faster than the single electron case . \n we thus expect no sharp features to show up in the photo  assisted shot noise at integer values of @xmath76 . \n in order to gain further insights for the backscattering current away from the tunneling regime , we study the limit @xmath1 where it is possible to refermionize . \n the various chiral current correlators which appear in the calculation of the dc backscattering noise and in the dc shot noise have been computed in this manner in ref . . \n the refermionized model involves the combinations of edge state densities : @xmath105 @xmath106 describes a free boson theory , whereas boundary and scattering effects are included in the solution for the fermion field operator @xmath107 which specifies @xmath108 . \n the hamiltonian which specifies the dynamics of this latter field is : @xmath109 \\psi(x ) + \\sqrt{2\\pi}\\delta(x)[\\gamma_0   \\psi^\\dagger(x)f+\\gamma_0^ *   f\\psi(x)]\\right\\}~,\\ ] ] were @xmath110 is a majorana fermion which satisfies @xmath111 and commutes with @xmath107 . note that the total bias voltage appears explicitly in the hamiltonian because a gauge transformation has been used on @xmath107 . in the presence of an ac voltage modulation , \n the heisenberg equations of motion become : @xmath112    the general solutions allow for a mismatch of the field operators at the impurity location : @xmath113    the matching condition for the @xmath114 and @xmath115 are obtained by integrating the equations of motion over the singularity : @xmath116 + 2i\\pi\\gamma_0 ^ 2 [ \\psi(0_+,t)+\\psi(0_-,t)-\\psi^\\dag(0_+,t)-\\psi^\\dag(0_-,t)]=0   ~. \\label{matching_condition}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this condition does not contain the dc voltage , nor the time dependent drive . \n one then substitutes the general solution for @xmath117 in the latter equation , and subsequently , one uses the generating function of the bessel function to obtain a the general relationship between the fourier components @xmath118 s and @xmath119 s . \n the details of this calculation are explicited in appendix [ appendixb ] . \n note that unlike ref . \n , the presence of the harmonic perturbation couples the fourier components at different frequencies . because here , we are interested in obtaining the modulation of the backscattering current as a first step , it is sufficient to solve such equation to @xmath120 . @xmath121 and @xmath122 \n are given by eqs . \n ( [ bbbb ] ) and ( [ bbbbdag ] ) . \n this completes the refermionization procedure in the presence of the harmonic time perturbation . \n note that a previous work on the photo - assisted current in the same geometry@xcite claims to have a general result for this situation , arguing that the ac modulation can be gauged - out by the transformation : @xmath123 . here , we note that the matching conditions used for this new field is : @xmath124 + 2i\\pi\\gamma_0 ^ 2 [ \\tilde{\\psi}(0_+,t)+\\tilde{\\psi}(0_-,t)-\\tilde{\\psi}^\\dag(0_+,t)-\\tilde{\\psi}^\\dag(0_-,t)]=0   ~ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so the matching condition itself becomes time dependent with this choice of gauge , because of the harmonic perturbation . \n this time contribution was discarded in ref . . \n the average backscattering current can be expressed in terms of the fermion density as follows : @xmath125 the details of the calculation are explained in appendix [ appendixb ] . the general result for \n the backscattering current reads : @xmath126 which is the final result for the backscattering current computed using the refermionization procedure , to first order in the harmonic perturbation . \n the perturbative result of eq . \n ( [ ordre2 ] ) can be recovered by choosing the limit @xmath127 , @xmath128 : @xmath129 we thus recover the perturbative result of eqs . \n ( [ ordre1 ] ) and ( [ ordre2 ] ) when @xmath1 . \n photo  assisted shot noise makes it possible to probe the transport properties of mesoscopic conductors in the time domain , as it is provides information which is directly related to the spectral density of noise . \n so far , such information has mainly focused on mesoscopic conductors where electron - electron interactions do not intervene , except via screening effects in the rpa approximation@xcite . \n the present study deals with the possible diagnosis of the `` simplest '' one dimensional correlated electron systems  a fractional quantum hall bar with two counter - propagating edge excitations  and showed in particular that the singularities in the noise and current provide information on the effective charges corresponding to laughlin fractions for the quantum hall fluid . \n although the present work bears close ties with previous work on finite frequency noise@xcite in the fractional quantum hall effect , a first principle derivation of photo - assisted shot noise in these systems was still lacking .    the bulk of the present results were derived in the context of perturbation theory , using two opposite limits ( weak and strong backscattering ) and shows that a direct diagnosis of quasiparticle tunneling can be reached for weak backscattering situations , while in the limit of strong backscattering , one does not expect much of a structure in the photo - assisted shot noise . for a correlated electron state such as @xmath92 , \n the noise and backscattering current for a weak impurity contain singularities at integer values of the fraction @xmath76 . at finite temperatures however , these singularities will be smeared out and the peak heights should scale as @xmath130 as in ref . , while they will also acquire thermal broadening . \n the condition for resolving the peaks in then @xmath131 , similarly to the temperature crossover of the dc regime . if one is to compare this diagnosis with the measurement of the fano factor in a dc shot noise measurement with the present procedure , one can argue that the extra degree of freedom provided by the probe frequency @xmath79 facilitates the monitoring of such singularities . \n a similar structure does not show up in the strong backscattering regime because , in this case , electron tunneling density of states are involved , rather than quasiparticle tunneling density of states . \n this suggest that photo  assisted transport could be used to probe , in future experiments , the crossover from the strong to the weak backscattering regimes in the fractional quantum hall effect .    in order to go beyond perturbation theory , a systematic , perturbative approach in the drive amplitude , \n was proposed , based on the refermionization procedure for @xmath1 . \n the photo - assisted current was derived to first order in this amplitude in the present work , but generalizations of this method , concerning the study of the rectification property of the current ( its zero frequency fourier transform ) or the photo  assisted shot noise are possible in principle , but they remain a challenge because of the need to pursue the calculation to higher orders in the drive amplitude .    note that the present work treats both edges as independent entities , which are only coupled via the tunneling hamiltonian of eq . \n ( [ tunneling_hamiltonian ] ) . \n a more precise model would include density - density interactions between both edges in the vicinity of the impurity , for instance described by a screened coulomb interaction . \n such interactions were considered for electron wave guides containing two coupled non - chiral luttinger liquids in section 7 of ref . , and \n the transport properties of this system through an impurity were analyzed in ref . , assuming that the interaction is effective over the whole length of the wire . \n here however , one focuses on a situation where the edge excitations have a chiral character . for the integer quantum hall effect \n , the screened interaction between two electron edge states were discussed previously@xcite . \n this interaction alone  over a finite length which characterizes the regions where the two edges are in close proximity  is understood to lead to backscattering of the collective excitations . \n indeed , the interaction between edges will give rise to a local inhomogeneity of the luttinger liquid interaction parameter , as seen in ref .  . \n although a full generalization to the fractional quantum hall situation is not fully available , it plausible that the same applies to the present situation . in the presence of such screened interaction , in the vicinity of the impurity , the `` proper '' excitations would mix right and left moving excitations , so that the tunneling hamiltonian and current operator would have to be rewritten in terms of new excitations which diagonalize the hamiltonian . \n one then expects for backscattering to be enhanced by the screened coulomb interaction . \n nevertheless , such inter - edge interaction will have a lesser role if the tunneling between the two edge states is weak , which is a working assumption of the present work . \n in fact , such considerations should first be addressed for a dc shot noise measurement in the fqhe alone , rather than in the present work , whose goal is to focus mainly on photo - assisted transport . \n several perspectives can be foreseen in the future . here , only simple laughlin fractions have been considered . yet \n the present approach \n probing transport in a correlated electron system with an external parameter ( the drive frequency )  in more complicated fractions of the quantum hall effect is highly relevant , because the charges at play depend on the geometry and the gating applied to the hall bar @xcite . \n another possible extension of the present results concerns non - chiral luttinger liquids , which find experimental applications in semiconductor quantum wires as well as for transport through carbon nanotubes . \n overall , photo  assisted transport constitutes a first step for studying the behavior of mesoscopic systems in non - stationary situations , which is relevant here for the understanding of the control of charge injection in the fractional quantum hall effect . \n one of us ( t.m . ) wishes to thank ntt basic research laboratories for their hospitality . \n early discussions with g.b . \n lesovik on photo  assisted shot noise are gratefully acknowledged . \n the following integrals are commonly used in the perturbation theory of luttinger liquids : @xmath132    with @xmath31 a keldysh index . \n the system of equations obtained from the general solution for @xmath133 and from its matching condition eq . \n ( [ matching_condition ] ) reads : @xmath134e^{-i\\omega t+i\\frac{\\omega_1}{\\omega}\\mathrm{sin}(\\omega t)}&=&\\sum_\\omega 2i\\pi\\gamma_0 ^ 2(a^\\dag_{-\\omega}+b^\\dag_{-\\omega})e^{-i\\omega t -

here we will account for it by means of a ginzburg - landau approach @xcite . to this end \n we have to define a phase field , or order parameter , @xmath0 ; differently from the approach followed , among others , by falk @xcite , the order parameter is not identified with the uniaxial strain @xmath1 , but rather the phase field @xmath0 is used here as a macroscopic indicator of the phase ( martensite or austenite ) of the material at every point @xcite . \n strain is an independent field , though it is coupled with the order parameter . \n we assume that the martensite phase be present in only two relevant variants , @xmath2 , characterised by opposite uniaxial transformation strains with respect to the austenite phase [ a ] , namely @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a fixed direction . \n the ginzburg - landau potential , whose properties will be described in detail in section [ sect : gl - pot ] , is expressly formulated to have ( at most ) three stable values of @xmath0 at values @xmath5 , corresponding to phases @xmath6 , respectively . \n we remark that , as a consequence of the _ first order _ character of the martensitic phase transition , intermediate values of @xmath0 do not represent any physically stable phase , but only transition layers between different stable or metastable physical phases . \n the model has to encompass evolution equations for the three basic fields : the order parameter ( @xmath0 ) , the strain ( @xmath7 ) and the temperature ( @xmath8 ) . \n the evolution of the phase field will be described by the tdgl equation @xmath9 the strain will be determined through the combination of the balance of linear momentum equation and a proper constitutive relation between strain , stress and order parameter , while the heat equation regulating the temperature evolution will arise from the balance of energy equation .    for the formulation of the model \n , we consider a bar sample of sma occupying a bidimensional material domain @xmath10 . \n we indicate with @xmath11 the material coordinates and with @xmath12 the displacement vector field . \n relying on the small displacement approximation , we use the linearised strain tensor @xmath13 $ ] . \n following berti et al . \n @xcite , we assume a ginzburg - landau free energy in the form @xmath14},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the temperature function @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 being @xmath17 the specific heat , @xmath18 a reference temperature for the specific heat , @xmath19 the compliance modulus , @xmath20 the stress tensor , @xmath21 the interface energy parameter regulating the interface width , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 material parameters related to the phase transition whose physical meaning will be explained in the following . \n the two potentials @xmath26 and @xmath27 are defined by @xmath28 } + \\frac{1}{8 } { \\left [ { 1 - \\cos { \\left ( { 2 \\pi { \\varphi } } \\right ) } } \\right]},\\\\    g({\\varphi } ) & = & 1 - \\cos { \\left ( { \\pi { \\varphi } } \\right)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the stress - strain diagrams referring to the tests performed at different strain rates for the values of the heat transfer coefficient @xmath29 and @xmath30 are reported in figs . \n [ fig : stress - strain - rate - h5 ] and [ fig : stress - strain - rate - h20 ] , respectively , together with the maximum number of martensite nuclei originated during the loading stage . \n the behaviour is the same described in section [ sect : strain - rate ] for the case @xmath31 . \n a ginzburg - landau model that reproduces the most relevant macroscopic features of the behaviour of a shape memory alloy has been considered . \n the model encompasses a time - dependent ginzburg - landau equation for the evolution of the phase order parameter , the balance of linear momentum and the heat equation , in order to account for the interplay between the transitional , mechanical and thermal aspects which strongly influences the behaviour of sma . starting from the theoretical model described in berti et al . \n @xcite , a new free energy based on trigonometric functions has been formulated and a suitable form of the relaxation parameter of the tdgl equation has been proposed . \n the resulting properties of the model ensure the driving force for the phase transition from austenite to martensite to be equal to the driving force for the transition from martensite to austenite and , consequently , provide a symmetrical behaviour of the model upon loading and unloading . \n numerical simulations have been performed to investigate the mechanical response of the model ; tensile tests on a bar specimen have been simulated under different conditions by changing the initial temperature , the maximum imposed strain , the nominal imposed strain - rate and the environmental conditions . \n the results obtained illustrate that the model is able to reproduce the main experimental evidences reported in literature @xcite . \n the simulated tensile tests show the presence of a stress drop during the phase nucleation , which may be absent in the unloading stage if the loading is interrupted before the completion of the phase transition ; temperature profiles consistent with the observed physical phenomena have also been described . \n the effect of the strain - rate on the mechanical response of the model have been investigated ; its impact on the number of nucleating domains , the nucleation stress , the stress relaxation during nucleation and on the slope of the stress plateau ( strain - hardening ) have been recovered . \n the role of the environmental conditions in the mechanical response have also been examined , and the concurrent influence of heat transfer conditions and strain - rate on the damping capacity and on the overall behaviour of the model have been described . \n the authors wish to thank prof . \n m. fabrizio and prof . \n molari for the inspiring discussions . \n 00 p. h. leo , t. w. shield and o. p. bruno , acta metall . \n 41 ( 8) , 24772485 ( 1993 ) . j. a. shaw and s. kyriakides , j. mech . phys . sol . 43 \n ( 8) , 12431281 ( 1995 ) . \n x. zhang , p. feng , y. he , t. yu and q. sun , int . \n 52 ( 12 ) , 16601670 ( 2010 ) . y. j. he and q. p. sun , int . \n 47 , 27752783 ( 2010 ) . \n y. he , h. yin , r. zhou and q. sun , mater . \n 64 , 14831486 ( 2010 ) . \n h. tobushi , y. shimeno , t. hachisuka and k. tanaka , mech . \n 30 , 141150 ( 1998 ) . \n a. paiva and m. a. savi , math . \n 2006 , 130 ( 2006 ) . \n s. leclerq , g. bourbon and c. lexcellent , j. phys . \n iii 5 , c2 - 513c2 - 518 ( 1995 ) . \n j. lubliner and f. auricchio , int . \n 33 ( 7 ) , 9911003 ( 1996 ) . \n f. auricchio and j. lubliner , int . \n 34 ( 27 ) , 36013618 ( 1997 ) . \n k. tanaka , res mech . \n 18 , 251263 ( 1986 ) . c. liang and c. a. rogers , j. intell . \n struct . 8 , 285302 ( 1997 ) . \n l. c. brinson , j. intell . \n struct . 4 , 229242 ( 1993 ) . \n l. c. brinson , a. bekker and s. hwang , j. intell . \n struct . 7 , 97107 ( 1996 ) . s. zhu and y. zhang , smart mater . struct . \n 16 , 16961707 ( 2007 ) . \n b. chang , j. a. shaw and m. a. iadicola , continuum mech . \n 18 , 83118 ( 2006 ) . \n r. abeyaratne , s. kim and j. k. knowles , int . \n 31 ( 16 ) , 22292249 ( 1994 ) . \n r. c. goo and c. lexcellent , acta mater . \n 45 , 727737 ( 1997 ) . \n i. muller and s. seelecke , math . \n comput . model . \n 34 , 13071355 ( 2001 ) . \n f. falk , acta metall . \n 28 , 17731780 ( 1980 ) . v. i. levitas and \n d. l. preston , phys . \n b 66 , 134206 ( 2002 ) . \n y. wang and a. g. khachaturyan , acta . \n 45 ( 2 ) , 759773 ( 1997 ) . \n r. ahluwalia , t. lookman , a saxena and r. c. albers , acta . \n 52 , 209218 ( 2004 ) . \n l. chen and w. yang , phys . \n b 50 ( 21 ) , 1575215756 ( 1994 ) . \n m. brocca , l. c. brinson and z. p. bazant , j. mech . \n 50 , 10511077 ( 2002 ) . \n v. berti , m. fabrizio , d. grandi , j. math . \n 51 , 062901 ( 2010 ) . \n f. daghia , m. fabrizio , d. grandi , meccanica 45 , 797807 ( 2010 ) . \n a. artemev , y. wang and a. khachaturyan , acta mater . \n 48 ( 10 ) , 25032518 ( 2000 ) . \n a. artemev , y. jin and a. khachaturyan , acta mater . \n 49 ( 7 ) , 11651177 ( 2001 ) . \n v. berti , m. fabrizio and d. grandi , phys . \n d 239 , 95102 ( 2010 ) . \n f. fried , m. e. gurtin , phys . \n d 68 ( 34 ) , 326343 ( 1993 ) . \n m. fabrizio , int . \n 44 ( 89 ) , 529539 ( 2006 ) . \n m. fabrizio , c. giorgi , a. morro , math . \n 31 , 627653 ( 2008 ) . c. polizzotto , eur . \n a / solids 22 , 651668 ( 2003 ) . \n a. logg and g. n. wells , acm trans . \n 37 ( 2 ) , article 20 , 28 pages ( 2010 ) . \n m. a. iadicola and j. a. shaw , smart mater . \n 16 , s155s169 ( 2007 ) . \n m. a. iadicola and j. a. shaw , int . j. plast . 20 \n ( 45 ) , 577605 ( 2004 ) .", "human_aspect": "{\n  \"background\": \"a ginzburg - landau model for the macroscopic behaviour of a shape memory alloy is proposed.\",\n  \"method\": \"the model is one - dimensional in essence , in that we consider the effect of the martensitic phase transition in terms of a uniaxial deformation along a fixed direction and we use a scalar order parameter whose equilibrium values describe the austenitic phase and the two martensitic variants . the model relies on a ginzburg - landau free energy defined as a function of macroscopically measurable quantities , and accounts for thermal effects ;

One of the most intriguing mysteries is how fully convective stars can produce large-scale magnetic fields and maintain their high level of activity. Recent observations of magnetic maps of these stars have revealed the presence of large magnetic regions in the stellar photosphere, which are mostly azimuthal and form partial or complete rings of azimuthal field encircling the star at various latitudes. These results suggest that dynamos operating in very active stars are different from those in the sun and are likely distributed throughout the convective envelope. This raises questions about how the magnetic field can be stored within the convective zone for long periods of time and provides new insights into how dynamos operate in fully convective stars. The observations also suggest that dynamo processes in these stars can activate a periodic exchange between magnetic and kinetic energy within the convective zone, which could be responsible for long-term fluctuations observed in the orbital period of close binary stars. Detecting variations in the differential rotation of active stars would provide a definite confirmation of this mechanism and of the existence of distributed dynamos.", "gpt35": "Despite the progress made in understanding magnetic fields in the sun and other cool active stars, astrophysicists are still far from a complete understanding. Conventional dynamo processes cannot explain the presence of large-scale magnetic fields and intense activity in fully convective stars. Recent observational results have shown the presence of large magnetic regions in the surface of these stars, suggesting that dynamos in active stars are different from those in the sun. This raises unresolved questions about how magnetic fields can be stored within the convective zone for long periods of time. The observations also provide insight into long-term fluctuations in the orbital period of close binary stars and suggest that dynamo processes throughout the convective zone may activate exchanges between magnetic and kinetic energy. Detecting variations in the differential rotation of active stars would confirm this mechanism and the existence of distributed dynamos. However, measuring surface differential rotation in active stars is challenging, and detecting changes even more so. Various methods have been proposed to estimate surface differential rotation, but they may not be applicable to the stars of interest.", "human": "this paper reports positive detections of surface differential rotation on two rapidly rotating cool stars at several epochs , by using stellar surface features ( both cool spots and magnetic regions ) as tracers of the large scale latitudinal shear that distorts the convective envelope in this type of stars . \n we also report definite evidence that this differential rotation is different when estimated from cool spots or magnetic regions , and that it undergoes temporal fluctuations of potentially large amplitude on a time scale of a few years . \n we consider these results as further evidence that the dynamo processes operating in these stars are distributed throughout the convective zone rather than being confined at its base as in the sun . by comparing our observations with two very simple models of the differential rotation within the convective zone , we obtain evidence that the internal rotation velocity field of the stars we investigated is not like that of the sun , and may resemble that we expect for rapid rotators . \n we speculate that the changes in differential rotation result from the dynamo processes ( and from the underlying magnetic cycle ) that periodically converts magnetic energy into kinetic energy and vice versa . \n we emphasise that the technique outlined in this paper corresponds to the first practical method for investigating the large scale rotation velocity field within convective zones of cool active stars , and offers several advantages over asteroseismology for this particular purpose and this specific stellar class . \n line : profiles  stars : activity  stars : imaging  stars : binaries  stars : magnetic fields  stars : rotation .", "article": "despite considerable progress obtained over the last century , astrophysicists are still far away from a thorough understanding on how magnetic fields are produced in the sun and other cool active stars ; the picture gets even worse when it comes to explain quantitatively how these fields generate the plethora of active phenomena observed both at their surface ( e.g.  dark spots ) and in their immediate surrounding ( e.g.  corona , wind ) . particularly interesting in this respect is the case of fully convective stars for which conventional dynamo processes ( supposed to concentrate mostly in the interface layer between the radiative interior and the convective envelope , i.e.  the only place where the field can be stored for a time comparable to the period of the activity cycle ) can not be invoked to justify , not only the presence of a large - scale magnetic field ( e.g.  johns - krull & valenti 1996 ) , but also their very intense activity level . \n the most recent observational results in this field , consisting of temporal series of magnetic maps obtained by indirect tomographic imaging from sets of rotationally modulated spectropolarimetric data ( donati et al . \n 1992 ; donati & cameron 1997 ; donati 1999 ; donati et al .  1999 ; donati et al .  2003 ; petit et al .  2003a , 2003b ) , are particularly intriguing and thus potentially very fruitful for providing new clues to what may be happening in the convective layers of these stars . \n all reconstructed magnetic maps to date indeed show the presence of large magnetic regions in the stellar photosphere where the field is mostly azimuthal ( i.e.  parallel to the surface and oriented along parallels ) ; moreover , these regions are often observed to form partial , or even complete , rings of azimuthal field encircling the star at various latitudes , and are thus interpreted as the direct detection , at photospheric level , of the quasi - axisymmetric toroidal component of the large - scale dynamo field . \n these results suggest in particular that dynamos operating in very active stars are likely to be significantly different than that of the sun . \n the observations indeed reveal that such dynamos are able to produce large scale field ( and especially toroidal field ) very close to the surface ( since we would not observe toroidal field in the photosphere otherwise ) , and presumably even throughout the whole convective zone ; dynamo processes in these stars are therefore likely distributed within the convective envelope , rather than being confined at its base as in the sun . \n this conclusion raises however a number of subsequent , and yet unresolved , problems ; we can no longer understand , for instance , how the magnetic field can be stored within the convective zone for periods of time as long as decades . at the same time \n , it may provide new insight for a number of long standing mysteries , and in particular for our comprehension on how dynamos operate in fully convective stars . \n one of these mysteries concerns the long - term fluctuations observed in the orbital period of close binary stars in which one member is at least a cool active star ( e.g.  hall 1990 ) , and occurring on a time scale of a few decades , i.e.  much shorter than what would be required for tidal coupling between system components to operate ( zahn 1989 ) . \n the least unreasonable interpretation for this phenomenon remains that proposed by applegate ( 1992 ) ; he suggests that dynamo processes at work in one star of the binary system activate a periodic exchange between magnetic and kinetic energy within the convective zone of this star , and thus a cyclic fluctuation of its quadrupolar moment as well as of its gravitational field . \n given the amplitude of the observed fluctuations in orbital period , one can easily infer that such magnetic to kinetic energy exchanges specific to dynamo processes must occur throughout the whole convective zone and not only within a thin layer ( lanza et al . \n 1998 ; donati 1999 ) , i.e.  that dynamo processes in these stars should indeed be distributed . \n if applegate s ( 1992 ) idea is true , it therefore implies that very active stars such as those found in close binary stars , but also young single stars that did not dissipate most of their angular momentum yet and still exhibit very energetic active phenomena , should feature a convective zone that globally undergoes such periodic exchanges between magnetic and kinetic energy . \n it means in particular that the internal velocity field within the convective zone of very active stars , and therefore both their radial and surface differential rotation profiles , should vary with time in a way correlated to the magnetic cycle . detecting such variations in the differential rotation of active stars \n thus appears as a very interesting observational challenge , as it would provide a definite confirmation of both applegate s ( 1992 ) mechanism and of the existence of distributed dynamos . \n it would also bring into a much wider astrophysical context the recent discovery that the solar angular rotation at the base of the convective zone is undergoing temporal fluctuations ( howe et al . \n 2000 ) as a probable consequence of the activity cycle .    measuring surface differential rotation of very active stars is however a rather tricky task ; detecting changes of this differential rotation is even more difficult . \n several methods have been proposed to estimate surface differential rotation . \n some of them try to make use of the subtle changes that differential rotation induce in the profile of spectral lines ( brunning 1981 ; reiners & schmitt 2002 ) ; this method can however not be used for the stars we are interested in , the spectral lines of which being heavily distorted by the presence of cool spots at their surfaces . \n other methods ( e.g.  donati & cameron 1997 ) propose to take advantage of these surface features , and use them as tracers to derive some information on how their rotation periods depend on latitude . \n the most recent of such techniques , that of cameron et al . \n ( 2002 ) , succeeded , not only in estimating surface differential rotation of one active star , but also in suggesting that temporal changes in the amount of differential rotation were indeed occurring in this star ( cameron & donati 2002 ) .    in this paper , we propose to make use of yet another technique , first proposed by donati et al . \n ( 2000 ) to estimate the differential rotation of a young pre - main - sequence star , then by petit et al . \n ( 2002 , 2003a , b ) both for simulation purposes and application to spectropolarimetric data . \n the aim of this paper is to apply this method to the extensive spectropolarimetric data set that we collected in the last seven yr for three stars , namely the young ultra - fast rotator ab  doradus , the young k0 star lq  hydrae and the k1 subgiant of the rs  cvn system hr  1099 , and from which yearly brightness and magnetic maps were obtained and published in the literature ( donati & cameron 1997 ; donati 1999 ; donati et al .  1999 , 2003 ) . \n in sect .  [ sect : modelling ] , we recall the main aspects of both observational material and modelling tool , then describe its application to the three selected stars in sect .  [ \n sect : diffrot ] ; after discussing at length the implication of our results for the understanding of the global dynamics of convective zones of cool stars ( in sect .  [ \n sect : discussion ] ) , we finally conclude and propose in sect .  [ \n sect : conclusion ] a few directions in which this work could be fruitfully extended . \n the data we use are the spectropolarimetric observations collected at the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) with a visitor polarimeter mounted at cassegrain focus and fibre linked to the high resolution ucl echelle spectrograph ( ucles ) . \n this material , and in particular the observing logs , the observing procedures and the data reduction details , are described extensively in a series of published papers that present the results obtained up to now ( donati et al . \n 1997 ; donati & cameron 1997 ; donati 1999 ; donati et al .  1999 , 2003 ) . \n the data we use in this paper are all observations of ab  dor , lq  hya and hr  1099 collected since epoch 1995.9 , i.e.  obtained in a similar spectrograph configuration . \n this makes a maximum amount of 7 data sets ( corresponding to epochs 1995.94 , 1996.99 , 1998.03 , 1999.00 , 1999.97 , 2000.93 and 2001.99 ) for each of the three stars ; we however anticipate that several of them ( and in particular those with very few data or collected over a timespan of no more than a few days , e.g.  those at epoch 1999.97 ) will be unusable for our purpose , according to the conclusions of petit et al . \n note that all data were reprocessed with the newest version of the reduction software ( donati et al . \n 2003 ) to ensure the highest possible internal accuracy in radial velocity as well as the best level of homogeneity . \n all data were run through least - squares deconvolution ( lsd ) , a multiline tool developed by donati et al . \n ( 1997 ) found to extract successfully the average rotationally broadened shape of unpolarised or circularly polarised lines ( called stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 lsd profiles in the following ) at each observed phase of the stellar rotational cycle , from the thousands of moderate to strong spectral features present in the recorded wavelength domain . \n as mentioned earlier , the method we chose to estimate surface differential rotation for the selected stars is that introduced by donati et al . \n ( 2000 ) , the validity of which was confirmed through an extensive sets of simulations by petit et al . \n recently , petit et al .  ( 2003a , \n b ) applied it successfully to large data sets collected over several years on a different telescope and with a different ( though similar ) instrumentation for two different stars , one of them being our third object of interest ( the k1 subgiant of hr  1099 ) and the other a giant star of fk  com type ( hd  199178 ) . \n this method consists in assuming a given surface differential rotation law ( that we implement in our indirect stellar surface imaging code ) and producing brightness or magnetic images of the stellar surface from all unpolarised or circularly polarised data available for this star at a given season ; we then take as most probable the differential rotation law that generates the images with lowest information content ( given a certain data fit accuracy ) , or equivalently the images that provide the best fit to the data ( given a certain image information content ) . in practice , \n both options yield very similar results ; the second one happens to be more convenient as it provides an easy way of estimating error bars on the differential rotation parameters ( see petit et al . \n 2002 ) . \n the stellar surface imaging code that we use is that of brown et al . \n ( 1991 ) and donati & brown ( 1997 ) , applied quite extensively to real data in the last decade ( the latest examples being donati et al . \n 2003 and petit et al . \n 2003a , b ) . \n it includes in particular the possibility of reconstructing images of stars that are differentially rotating , i.e.  of taking into account explicitly the differential rotation pattern in the imaging process . \n the surface differential rotation law we assume in this paper is given by the following equation : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the rotation rate at colatitude @xmath4 ,  the rotation rate of the equator and  the difference in rotation rate between the pole and equator . \n at each season , one brightness and one magnetic image is produced from the full stokes @xmath0 and stokes @xmath1 data sets respectively , for each selected pair of differential rotation parameters within a reasonable search domain of the   plane . \n this typically means that we have to compute a few hundred brightness and magnetic images for each star at each season , which therefore requires large amount of computing time ; for instance , in the particular case of the stokes @xmath0 data set of ab  dor at epoch 2001.99 where as much as 27,400 data points must be fitted simultaneously , we typically need a few days of computing time on the fastest available workstations to derive how the reduced  of the fit to the data varies with the differential rotation parameters at a good enough resolution . \n a typical example of the reduced  maps we obtain from stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 data is shown in fig . \n [ fig : csqmaps ] . \n it could be argued that , in the sake of computing time , we could actually derive the optimal differential rotation parameters as part of the imaging process itself , since this would mean no more than fitting another two parameters in addition to the thousands of image pixels we already have to deal with . \n however , our experience is that the  maps we obtain are not always as nice as those shown in fig . \n [ fig : csqmaps ] , and sometimes do not feature any physically meaningful minimum . \n we therefore preferred to keep our initial procedure , and check in each case whether the obtained reduced   maps showed a clear enough minimum to be able to claim safely that differential rotation is indeed detected at the corresponding epoch . \n another very important advantage of producing reduced  maps is that they can also be used in a very straightforward way to obtain error bars on our estimates of the differential rotation parameters . \n following press et al . \n ( 1992 ) , we indeed know that the 1  @xmath5 confidence interval for each differential rotation parameter taken separately can be obtained by searching for all points of the   plane for which the  increase ( with respect to the minimum value in the map ) is smaller than 1 to [ fig : hrdriv ] , which includes all points of the map for which the  increase is smaller than 2.3 ] ( or equivalently for which the reduced  increase is smaller than @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of fitted data points ) , and projecting this ellipsoid onto the  and  axes respectively . the simplest way to evaluate these projections ( and thus the formal error bars for each parameter ) is to compute the curvature radii of the  paraboloid at its minimum and the correlation coefficient between the two parameters ; for a  paraboloid with linear and quadratic terms given by @xmath8 , the value of the optimal parameters and the associated error bars simply write : @xmath9 @xmath10    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : param ]    the conservation of angular momentum within the convective zone therefore implies , in our first test case , the following relation between  and : @xmath11  being a constant , equal to the rotation rate the stellar convective zone would have if spinning as a solid body . in our second test case , this relation becomes : @xmath12 implying in particular that the linear relationship between   and  is significantly less steep than in our first test case ( see table  [ tab : param ] ) . \n it may be worthwhile to note that , although   and  refer specifically to the differential rotation parameters at the surface of the star , eq . \n [ eq : rela ] still holds when replacing  and  by their equivalents estimated at radial distance @xmath13 from the centre of the star ( and noted respectively @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) since both do not show any dependence with @xmath13 in this particular case ; however , this is not true in the second test case , where eq . \n [ eq : relb ] becomes , when expressed as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is equal to @xmath18 with @xmath19 denoting the squared fractional radius @xmath20 . in our second test case \n , we therefore expect the relationship between @xmath15 and @xmath14 to change ( turning steeper with decreasing @xmath13 ) depending on the depth at which the tracers used to estimate differential rotation are anchored . \n we can also derive by the same method an expression giving the kinetic energy @xmath21 within the convective zone . the general formula , writing : @xmath22 becomes , in our first test case : @xmath23\\ ] ] and in the second test case : @xmath24\\ ] ] where @xmath25 stands for : @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the sixth order moment of the fractional radius @xmath28 . in both cases \n , we obtain that @xmath21 can be written as the sum of two terms , one that we know is constant ( given eqs . \n [ eq : rela ] and [ eq : relb ] , reflecting the conservation of angular momentum ) and a second , potentially variable , one , directly proportional to @xmath29 . to compute the actual variation in kinetic energy @xmath30 \n , one must note that  can itself be written as the sum of two terms : @xmath31 where  and  respectively represent the minimum value of the observed photospheric shear ( that corresponding to the state closest to solid body rotation ) and the variable contribution to . in this context , the variation of kinetic energy induced by the differential rotation changes writes : @xmath32 ( @xmath25 being replaced by 8/175 in our first test case ) \n .    it could be tempting to consider that the whole variation in kinetic energy is transformed into magnetic energy as part of the magnetic cycle ( as proposed by lanza et al . \n however , this conclusion first requires that we obtain an expression similar to that derived above for @xmath30 ( see eq . \n [ eq : dk ] ) , but for the associated changes in potential energy that result from the fluctuations in the internal angular velocity field and thus to the variations in the shape of the star . \n we could then derive which fraction of the kinetic plus potential energy is converted into magnetic energy during the activity cycle . \n similarly , we could also obtain estimates of the fluctuations in the in the stellar quadrupole moment ( as done for instance by applegate 1992 ) , but in the specific context of our study ( i.e.  with the internal velocity fields assumed above in eqs . \n [ eq : drsun ] and [ eq : drufr ] ) . \n we however keep this out of this initial study and postpone it for future papers ; it is nevertheless rather safe to claim that the amount of kinetic energy transformed into magnetic energy is of the same magnitude as ( though not strictly equal to ) @xmath30 .      if we now compare the model predictions obtained in sect . \n [ sect : momentum ] with our observations , we straightforwardly obtain that the second test case ( featuring constant angular velocity along cylinders within the convective zone ) seems much more appropriate . \n it is indeed only in this case that different depths in the convective zone correspond to different angular shears ( see eqs . \n [ eq : drsun ] and [ eq : drufr ] ) , thus providing a natural explanation of the discrepancy between the  and  estimates derived from stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 data . \n if this is indeed the correct interpretation , it would imply that magnetic features , showing the strongest shear , are in general anchored closer to the surface ( where @xmath15 is maximum ) than cool spots . \n this is at least in qualitative agreement with the conclusions of , e.g. , donati et al . \n ( 2003 ) , claiming that magnetic features ( and in particular those hosting predominantly azimuthal fields ) must be formed very close to the surface in these stars . \n further support about the idea that dynamo magnetic fields ( and in particular their toroidal components ) can be produced very close to the stellar surface comes from the recent discovery that the sun features a subphotospheric layer with a strong radial gradient in angular rotation ( corbart & thompson 2002 ) that seems at least able to trigger dynamo action ( dikpati et al .  2002 ) .    however , there is already a number of potential problems with this simple description . \n it implies for instance that the range of possible latitudinal shears we should observe on a given star at a given epoch goes from  at the surface , down to @xmath33 at the bottom of the convective zone , i.e.  that the maximum ratio between the shears we measure from stokes @xmath1 and stokes @xmath0 data should be @xmath34 . \n although this is verified for ab  dor ( for which the measured ratio varies from 1.25 to 1.8 and thus remains always smaller than the maximum predicted value of @xmath35 ) , the situation is different for lq  hya where we observe ( at epoch 2001.99 ) differential rotation shears in stokes @xmath1 and stokes @xmath0 that differ by a factor of about 6 ( see table  [ tab : lqhya ] ) , much larger than the theoretical maximum of 1.9 . \n the origin of this discrepancy is not clear yet ; the fact that only one point ( out of the seven for which measurements from stokes @xmath0 and @xmath1 data are available ) exhibits this problem tells at least that the model we propose , although probably oversimplified , is not necessarily a complete nonsense . \n one possibility is that the model we consider does not take into account the additional shears that probably exist in the interface layer between the convective envelope and the radiative interior , nor that associated with a potential subsurface shear similar to that of the sun ( corbard & thompson 2002 ) ; we may thus imagine that , in some rare cases , the bulk of the differential rotation tracers we use is anchored in these thin shear layers , producing a small number of observations in disagreement with our simple picture . \n it may also indicate that the differential rotation estimate secured for lq  hya at epoch 2001.99 from stokes @xmath0 data is affected by some spurious contribution that we have not yet identified ( values derived from stokes @xmath1 data being always more reliable and less prone to systematic effects ) ; although we are of course fully aware that is a rather unsatisfying and potentially worrying statement , we can not yet rule out this possibility completely until a larger sample of estimates are available for us to check if this problem is truly an exception or rather a regular occurence . in the rest of the study , we exclude this point from the analysis and further investigate how compatible is the toy model we propose with the rest of our data . \n a quantitative test consists in measuring the slope of the  versus  relations that we obtain for each star by taking into account all estimates derived in sect . \n [ sect : diffrot ] ( and shown on figs . \n [ fig : abdriv ] to [ fig : hrdriv ] ) and comparing it to those the model predict ( see eqs . \n [ eq : rela ] to [ eq : relc ] ) . to determine the optimal linear relationship that provides the best fit through all data points and their associated confidence ellipses for each star ( something that a conventional least - squares fit , not taking into account the correlated errors on both axes , can not properly achieve ) \n , we iteratively consider a large number of such relationships ( i.e.  a large number of @xmath36 and  pairs ) and compute , for each of them , the closest approach ( in terms of ) to all error ellipses and the associated overall goodness of fit ( defined as the sum of the minimum square distances to each ellipse ) . from these values , we derive a  map ( in the @xmath37 plane ) , look for a minimum and fit the map by a bi - dimensional paraboloid in the neighbourhood of this minimum ( by a method similar to that described in sect . \n [ sect : modelling ] ) to obtain both the optimum values of @xmath36 and  as well as the corresponding error bars .    for ab  dor and using all the estimates listed in table  [ tab : abdor ] ( 10 points altogether with their associated error ellipses ) , \n we obtain from this procedure that the minimum achievable reduced  is 10.5 , already indicating that the model provides a rather poor explanation of our observations . \n when 2 ( out of the 10 available ) differential rotation estimates are removed from the full sample ( those obtained from stokes @xmath0 data at epoch 1995.94 and from stokes @xmath1 data at epoch 2001.99 ) on the reason that they deviate most from the fit including all points ( at a level of about 5  @xmath5 ) , the minimum achievable reduced  decreases to a smaller , but still uncomfortably high , value of 4.8 , yielding values of @xmath36 and  equal to @xmath38 and @xmath39   respectively ( with 1  @xmath5 error bars enhanced by a factor of @xmath40 to reflect the poor fit obtained with this model ) . \n note that the value of @xmath36 we derive agrees well with that predicted for the second test model ( equal to 0.52 , see table  [ tab : abdor ] ) . \n if we now impose @xmath36 to be equal to 0.2 ( the value predicted for our first test model ) , the minimum reduced  that we can now achieve is about 2.6 times larger than that obtained without constraining @xmath36 . \n this strongly suggests that our first model ( assuming solar - like differential rotation within the convective zone ) is a much less probable option than the second one ( assuming constant angular velocity along cylinders within the convective zone ) , event hough the accuracy to which the observations are fitted with this second model is still not satisfactory .    to investigate whether the agreement with the data can be improved \n , the best way is to attempt exploiting all built - in characteristics of our simple model , for instance by taking explicitly into account , when comparing with the data , the fact that the different types of tracers may be anchored at different convective depths . to achieve this , we proceed along the lines presented in sect .  [ \n sect : momentum ] and try to measure the differential rotation estimates corresponding to stokes @xmath0 and stokes @xmath1 data with different linear relationships ( using eqs . \n [ eq : relc ] and [ eq : lambdap ] ) . \n more specifically , we proceed as explained in the paragraphs above , except that we now have three independent parameters , @xmath36 ( the slope of the  versus   relationship in the stokes @xmath1 data , presumably referring to the surface layers ) , @xmath41 ( the slope of this relationship in the stokes @xmath0 data , presumably referring to deeper convective layers ) and one value of . \n the only difference from the previous procedure is that we now fit a three dimensional ( instead of a two dimensional ) paraboloid to the   map . \n this new modelling attempt ( with the same two data points excluded ) yields a minimum reduced  of 3.2 , along with values of @xmath36 , @xmath41 and  respectively equal to @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44  ( error bars being again scaled up in proportion to the square root of the reduced ) . \n although the fit to the data is now more satisfactory and the derived value of @xmath41 falls within the expected range ( between 0.13 and 0.40 , given the inverse squared fractional anchoring depths @xmath45 obtained from ratioing the estimated shears at each epoch , see above ) , the value of @xmath36 we extract is poorly compatible with that we expect for the surface layers ( equal to 0.52 ) , with a mismatch of about 3  @xmath5 . repeating the procedure with @xmath36 being fixed to the expected value of 0.5 yields no improvement in the accuracy level to which the data are fitted with respect to the two parameter fit described above . \n we therefore conclude that the estimates of differential rotation and of its temporal variations at the surface of ab  dor suggest that the distribution of angular velocities within the convective zone is closer to that we expect for rapid rotators than to that of the sun . \n however , the simple model we propose , in addition to the fact that the accuracy level to which it fits the data is only rough , also predicts some features that are not reproduced in the observations , and in particular the different slopes of the linear  versus  relationships expected for tracers anchored at different convective depths . \n what it may simply indicate is that our test models are still far too simple to match the observations at that level of detail . \n further attempts , with more realistic large scale angular velocity fields in the convective zone will be the subject of forthcoming papers . \n the first part of this experiment can also be applied to our lq  hya data . using the two parameter fitting procedure described above through the available measurements ( 4 points with associated error ellipses , once discarded the estimate from stokes @xmath0 data obtained at epoch 2001.99 , see above ) , we obtain values of @xmath36 and  that are respectively equal to @xmath46 and @xmath47  and provide a nice fit to the data , with an associated reduced  level of 0.84 . for this star \n again , we obtain that the slope of the observed versus  linear relationship is not compatible with a solar like differential rotation within the convective zone ; repeating the same procedure with @xmath36 fixed to 0.2 ( as required by our first test model ) increases the minimum reduced  up to 7.2 , i.e.  8.4 times that achieved with the unconstrained fit . assuming now constant angular velocity along cylinders , the model would then require the tracers to be anchored at about mid depth within the convective zone ( at a fractional radius of about 0.86 ) to agree with the observations . \n another possibility is of course that the internal velocity field of lq  hya is somehow intermediate between that of a very fast rotator like ab  dor and that of a slow rotator like the sun , reflecting the fact that the rotation rate of lq  hya ( 3.9  ) is bracketed by that of ab  dor ( 12.2  d ) and that of the sun ( 0.25  ) . in this context , \n contours of constant angular rotation within the convective zone should start deviating from being aligned with the rotation axis , and get slightly tilted towards the radial direction . once again , we caution that these conclusions are still highly speculative and require more observational material ( in particular measurements on other stars rotating slower and faster than lq  hya ) to be settled more firmly .    carrying out a similar investigation in the particular case of hr  1099 \n would also be very interesting , as our second model predicts a significantly higher slope for the  versus  linear relation ( equal to about 0.68 , see table  [ tab : param ] ) due to the fact that the convective zone ( pertaining more than 99% of the total stellar volume ) is much deeper in this star \n . the smaller rotation rate of hr  1099 ( 2.2  ) may also act at the same time to decrease the value of @xmath36 with respect to the predicted one . \n since no temporal variations of differential rotation are however yet detected on hr  1099 , all this remains essentially a matter of speculation , until more accurate estimates ( such as those of petit et al . \n 2002 , but covering a longer time span ) are available . \n another important aspect of this problem concerns the amount of kinetic energy that the star either withdraws from or releases into the total energy reservoir of the convective zone when switching from one state of differential rotation to another . \n in particular , we should make sure that the total power associated with the energy transfer from or into kinetic energy is significantly smaller , or at the very least not larger , than the stellar luminosity itself , to ensure that the process we invoke to explain our observations ( which in principle should apply to the vast majority of rapidly rotating cool stars ) does not implicitly require at the same time that the star looses its energy at a very fast rate . \n of course , we reckon that the energy transfers we invoke likely correspond to some redistribution process between the various reservoirs in which the convective zone can store energy ( i.e.  kinetic , potential and magnetic energy wells ) ; however , we suspect that these transfers are inevitably associated with some energy dissipation , i.e.  that a significant fraction ( the exact proportion being poorly known ) of the energy transfered is lost ( and thus radiated ) in the process .    the changes in kinetic energy associated with the differential rotation fluctuations can easily be estimated from eq . \n [ eq : dk ] . in the case of ab \n dor , the results reported in sect . \n [ sect : abdor ] suggest that   and  are respectively equal to 60 and 40  , implying that @xmath30 should be equal to @xmath48 or about @xmath49  erg . assuming this transfer occurs progressively over a typical timespan of a few years ( @xmath50  s ) \n , we obtain that the power required to operate the change we invoke corresponds to about 1% of the total stellar luminosity . \n ( note that @xmath30 is only weakly dependent on the assumed internal velocity field , varying only by a factor of about two between our two test models ) . \n for lq  hya , our observations indicate that  is probably close to zero while  gets as large as 200  , implying that @xmath30 should now be equal to @xmath51 or about @xmath52  erg . \n if we again consider that the corresponding evolution occurs on a time scale of a few years , we find that the associated power corresponds to 10% of the total stellar luminosity . \n although this sounds rather large already , one must keep in mind that only a small fraction of this amount is actually lost ( i.e.   radiated ) in the process ; it suggests that , even in the case of the star that exhibits the most drastic effect ( i.e.  lq  hya ) , the corresponding power dissipated in the process does probably not exceed 1% of the stellar luminosity . since no temporal changes were detected in the case of hr  1099 , we thus can not obtain a similar estimate without any ( hopefully reasonable ) assumption on  and . \n taking @xmath53 and @xmath54   as a guess ( and to remain grossly compatible with the differential rotation changes that the orbital period fluctuations observed on this system request , donati 1999 ) , we obtain that @xmath30 reaches as much as @xmath55  erg and that the associated power required to drive this change corresponds to about 3% of the stellar luminosity ( provided the change in  occurs over a few years ) . \n if we finally assume that most of the changes in kinetic energy associated with the fluctuations in differential rotation are associated with equal ( and opposite ) variations in magnetic energy occurring throughout the whole convective zone , we can obtain a very rough estimate of the average magnetic field strength required to drive these changes . \n we caution that this estimate is necessarily very rough for at least several reasons . \n the first reason is of course that the magnetic field is expected to be very intermittent throughout the convective zone and to exhibit a strong gradient in the radial direction ( comparable to the one that the gas pressure undergoes ) , implying that an average magnetic field strength over the whole convective volume is not extremely meaningful ; the second reason ( already mentioned above ) is that fluctuations in potential energy are also expected to occur ( as a consequence of the changes in the shape of the star ) and probably participate as well in the total energy budget . \n however , a rough estimate being better than no estimate , we decided to mention in the paper the derived average magnetic strengths , to at least convince the readers that the magnitude of these fields is physically plausible . for ab \n dor and lq  hya , we obtain magnetic intensities of 9 and 23  kg respectively ; using the above guesses in the case of hr  1099 yields a field strength of 5  kg . \n this is clearly larger that the magnetic strengths estimated at the surface ( e.g.  donati 1999 ; donati et al . \n 2003 ) , and reflects the strong radial gradient of field strength ( pointing inwards ) that probably exists within the convective zone . \n this paper reports positive detections of surface differential rotation on two rapidly rotating cool stars at several epochs , by using stellar surface features ( both cool spots and magnetic regions ) as tracers of the large scale latitudinal shear that distorts the convective envelope in this type of stars . \n we also report definite evidence that this differential rotation is different when estimated from cool spots or magnetic regions , and that it undergoes temporal fluctuations of potentially large amplitude on a time scale of a few years . \n we consider these results as further evidence that the dynamo processes operating in these stars are distributed throughout the convective zone rather than being confined at its base as in the sun . with the help of two very simple models of the angular velocity field within the convective zone ( one that resembles that of the sun and one supposed to represent that of ultra fast rotators ) , we explore the quantitative implications that angular momentum conservation within the convective zone imposes on potential variations of surface differential rotation with time . \n this modelling suggests , from comparison with our observations , that the rotation velocity field within the convective zone of the stars we investigated is not like that of the sun , and may resemble that we expect for rapid rotators , with constant angular velocity along cylinders aligned with the rotation axis . \n the power required to drive the observed changes in the differential rotation of the convective zone are estimated to be of the order of 1 to 10% of the total stellar luminosity ; we speculate that these changes result from the dynamo processes ( and from the underlying magnetic cycle ) that periodically converts magnetic energy into kinetic energy and vice versa .    the technique outlined in this paper corresponds to the first practical method for investigating the large scale rotation velocity field in convective zones of cool active stars . \n in particular , we note that it can already provide us with more information than what one could obtain with other existing techniques such as asteroseismology ( expected to yield rather poor resolution on the internal rotation profile in the radial direction , even when operated from space , at least in the next decade ) . \n we therefore strongly argue in favour of renewing the experiment reported here , in order to explore more extensively the full capabilities of this new method \n . monitoring continuously the same star for time spans as long as several months every year for several years would be especially interesting if one wants to disclose short term chaotic variability ( presumably due to the natural randomness inherent to turbulence and differential rotation ) from the long term supposedly periodic evolution driven by the magnetic cycle .    in this context , \n the new spectropolarimeter espadons , designed for maximum efficiency and being built for the 3.6  m canada - france - hawaii telescope ( commissioning scheduled for spring 2003 ) , represents the optimal instrumental facility for carrying the observations that this new method requires . \n we expect in particular that the large gain in sensitivity that this new tool will provide over older generation instruments should give us the opportunity of both extending the available data set to a much larger sample of stars and studying the physical processes of interest to us in much more details . \n this research program will also strongly benefit from having similar instruments on smaller telescopes to allow the long , repeated and if possible multisite , observational campaigns that are necessary for optimising the performances of the investigation we suggest . in this respect , \n the 2  m bernard lyot telescope atop pic du midi in france , that will soon be equipped with narval ( a carbon copy of espadons , whose construction just started ) and dedicated to spectropolarimetric studies , should be extremely useful for this kind of research . \n we warmly thank corinne charbonnel for kindly providing us with some models of the internal structure of the three stars on which this study is focused . \n we are also grateful to the referee , rob jefferies , for making very detailed and relevant comments that allowed us to improve the paper substantially .", "human_aspect": "{\n  \"background\": \"this paper reports positive detections of surface differential rotation on two rapidly rotating cool stars at several epochs, by using stellar surface features (both cool spots and magnetic regions) as tracers of the large scale latitudinal shear that distorts the convective envelope in this type of stars.\",\n  \"method\": \"the technique outlined in this paper corresponds to the first practical method for investigating the large scale rotation velocity field within convective zones of cool active stars, and offers several advantages over asteroseismology for this particular purpose and this specific stellar class.\",\n  \"result\": \"we also report definite evidence that this differential rotation is different when estimated from cool spots or magnetic regions, and that it undergoes temporal fluctuations of potentially large amplitude on a time scale of a few years.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"we consider these results as further evidence that the dynamo processes operating in these stars are distributed throughout the convective zone rather than being confined at its base as in the sun.

row charge injection ( @xcite ; @xcite ) was used to reduce the effects of radiation damage . \n we used version 2.4.12.27 of the processed data for hess  j1427608 . \n the data was analyzed with the headas software version 6.10 and xspec version 12.6.0 . \n we used the cleaned event file created by the suzaku team . \n the resultant effective exposure was 104  ks . \n figure 1 shows xis images in the soft ( 0.52  kev ) and the hard ( 28  kev ) bands . \n the images were corrected for exposure using an exposure map generated by the ftool xisexpmapgen after subtracting non x - ray background ( nxb ) images generated by the ftool xisnxbgen @xcite . \n finally , the xis1 and xis3 images were added , and the resulting image was binned to a pixel size of and smoothed with a gaussian of @xmath15 . \n the position center and the extent of hess  j1427608 are shown as a black cross and a yellow dashed circle , respectively . \n a few faint , point - like sources are seen in the soft band , while an apparently extended source is detected in the hard band . \n the position and apparent extension of the hard source match those of hess  j1427608 . as will be shown in a later section , all the suzaku soft - band sources \n may be explained by the point - like sources in the xmm - newton archive data while the suzaku hard - band source seems to be a truly new source . \n we thus designate the central hard - band source suzaku  j14276051 , and mainly focus on this source in the following analysis . \n because hess  j1427608 and suzaku  j14276051 are both extended , we evaluate the x - ray size of the source . \n for this purpose , careful estimation of the x - ray background is necessary since suzaku  j14276051 is relatively faint . in particular \n , this region contains significant contribution from the galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) as well as the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , both of which are subject to mirror vignetting effect resulting in a centrally - peaked spatial distribution . \n therefore , it is not appropriate to assume a flat background image defined at an off - source region within the field of view ( fov ) . instead , we estimated the grxe+cxb image in the source region through monte - carlo simulation . \n we explain details of the x - ray background estimation below . \n first , we estimated the surface brightness of the grxe and cxb assuming their uniform distribution in the sky . for this purpose \n , we analyzed the x - ray spectrum in the off - source annulus region shown in figure  [ fig : xisspecreg ] . \n the region ( between and from the center of suzaku  j14276051 ) was selected to minimize contamination from suzaku  j14276051 . in other words , \n the off - source region contains only the grxe and the cxb after the subtraction of nxb . \n figure  [ fig : xisanuspec ] shows the spectra extracted from the off - source region . \n the spectra were modeled by optically thin thermal three temperature plasma with neutral iron emission line plus the cxb following @xcite . \n in the course of model fitting , the hydrogen column density was fixed to @xmath16 determined by hi observations ( @xcite ) , the photon index of the cxb to 1.4 , and the surface brightness of the cxb to @xmath17 in the 210  kev band ( @xcite ) . \n we made the ancillary response file using the ftool xissimarfgen assuming a uniform emission in the sky . \n the model could reproduce the observed spectrum well . \n the best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ tab : xisanuspec ] . \n next , we simulated the grxe+cxb event data assuming uniform emission with the best - fit spectrum model determined above using the ftool xissim @xcite . in order to avoid an extra ambiguity due to poor statistics , the exposure time for the simulation \n was set to 500 ks . \n then we extracted the grxe+cxb spectrum in the source region and added it to the nxb in the source region to obtain the total background spectrum , following the instruction in section 5.5.2 of the suzaku technical description . \n figure  [ fig : xisspeccomp ] shows the simulated background spectra of the xis1 and xis3 respectively as well as the source and off - source spectra . as can be seen from the spectra , the source region contains significant emission above the grxe+cxb level . \n figure  [ fig : xisprof ] shows the radial profiles of the nxb - subtracted image and the simulated grxe+cxb image in the 28  kev band . \n the difference is attributed to suzaku  j14276051 . even if we consider the relatively broad half - power radius (; \n @xcite ) of the point spread function of suzaku mirror , suzaku  j14276051 is clearly extended . in order to estimate the source extent , we compared the observed radial profile with that of a model calculation for an extended source having a 2d - gaussian distribution . instead of performing the @xmath18 fitting , we calculated @xmath18 for a set of @xmath19 , i.e. , , , , and . \n the simulated profiles were generated with xissim . \n it turned out that none of them gave an acceptable fit ; the radial profile of suzaku  j14276051 has a core and a tail in comparison with the best - fit simulation data . \n we thus performed the @xmath18 test using only the core region ( @xmath20 ) . \n we then could obtain an acceptable fit ( @xmath21 for 3 degrees of freedom ) . \n the best - fit value obtained was @xmath0 with 90% confidence level . \n although suzaku  j14276051 is extended , we tried to search for pulsations in the xis light curve as point sources may be hidden in the image . \n we extracted light curves of the source region in the 0.510  kev band and binned them to a time resolution of 16 sec . \n we calculated fourier power spectra every 2048  bin ( @xmath22  9.1  hour ) using the ftool powspec to obtain the ensemble - averaged power spectrum density ( psd ) . \n the psd of xis1 is dominated by the orbital period of the satellite and its higher harmonics , probably due to the contamination of earth albedo . \n thus we used only the psd of xis3 in the subsequent analysis . \n no significant peak was detected in the psd with an upper limit of @xmath23 ( poisson fluctuation level was normalized to 2.0 ) , which corresponds to an rms amplitude of 0.0064  count  s@xmath11 . \n because the net count rate of the source is 0.021  count  s@xmath11 , this corresponds to a relative amplitude of 31% . \n thus we conclude that no coherent pulsation is present in the light curves of suzaku j14276051 with an upper limit of 31 % between the pulse periods of 32  sec and 32768  sec . \n figure  [ fig : xisspec ] shows the background - subtracted energy spectra of suzaku  j14276051 . here \n , the background spectrum ( sum of grxe , cxb , and nxb ) was calculated with the method detailed in section  [ subsec : xisimage ] . \n it is found that the spectrum of suzaku  j14276051 is featureless and heavily absorbed . \n although a hint of feature is seen in the 67  kev band , which may be due to the spacial variation of the iron emission line in grxe , it is not statistically significant . \n we calculated the ancillary response file using the ftool xissimarfgen for an extended source of a gaussian profile with @xmath24 . \n the spectrum was well modeled by either an absorbed power - law or a thermal model , whose best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ tab : xisparm ] . however , \n a thermal origin is unlikely because the abundance is unreasonably small , and the x - rays are thus considered to be produced by non - thermal processes . \n the absorbed x - ray flux of the source is @xmath25 in the 210  kev band . \n we also analyzed the spectrum of the hxd to search for emission of suzaku  j14276051 above 10  kev . \n we used the background spectrum called `` bgd_d '' provided by the suzaku team @xcite and added the cxb to it using the ftool hxdpinnxbpi . \n we used the xis nominal - position response file categorized to epoch 6 , released as a caldb . \n we made the background - subtracted spectrum and fitted it with a power - law , whose photon index was fixed to @xmath26 , as derived from the xis analysis . \n the flux in the 1540  kev band is ( @xmath27 ) @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) if no systematic error is taken into account . \n based on @xcite , who showed the reproducibility of nxb in the 1540  kev band is about 3% in the 90% confidence range , we constructed the nxb spectra with 3% higher count rates to include the systematic error of the nxb reproduction . \n then , a significant signal is no longer detected . \n we thus obtained the 90% upper limit of @xmath30 in the 1540  kev band . \n in order to estimate the contribution of point sources , we analyzed the archival data of xmm - newton including the hess  j1427608 field . \n xmm - newton ( @xcite ) carries three x - ray telescopes each equipped with a european photon imaging camera ( epic ) at the foci . \n epic consists of two mos ccd camera ( mos1 and mos2 : @xcite ) and a pn ccd camera ( pn : @xcite ) . \n the observation was carried out on 2007 august 9 for 24  ks . during the observation , epic was operated in full - frame mode with medium filter . \n the data were analyzed with the science analysis software ( sas ) version 10.0.0 , headas version 6.10 and xspec version 12.6.0 . \n time intervals of enhanced background , which are caused by soft proton flares , were removed with thresholds of 0.20  count  s@xmath11 for mos1 , 0.24  count  s@xmath11 for mos2 , and 0.6  count  s@xmath11 for pn , respectively , calculated for pattern=0 events above 10  kev . \n we used x - ray events of pattern=012 ( for mos cameras ) and pattern=04 ( for pn camera ) for the image and spectral analyses . \n the resultant effective exposures were 21  ks ( mos1 ) , 22  ks ( mos2 ) , and 15  ks ( pn ) , respectively . \n the journal of the observation is listed in table  [ tab : obslog ] . \n figure  [ fig : epicimage ] shows the summed images of mos1 and mos2 in the soft ( 0.32  kev ) and the hard ( 212  kev ) bands . \n the xis images are also overlaid in green contours . using the sas tool edetect_chain , \n a total of 16 point sources were detected within from the center of suzaku  j14276051 . \n eleven and seven sources were found in the soft and the hard bands , respectively , and two sources were commonly detected in both bands . \n names and count rates of the point sources are listed in table  [ tab : xmmps ] . \n summing up the count rates of the point sources located within the suzaku source region ( x1 through x7 ) , we obtained @xmath31  count  s@xmath11 in the 0.52  kev band . \n this may be converted to the xis bi count rate of @xmath32  count  s@xmath11 assuming the power - law spectrum in table 2 . because this is comparable to the rate actually observed with suzaku ( @xmath33  count  s@xmath11 ) , \n the xis data may be explained by the sum of the xmm - newton point sources in the soft band . \n on the other hand , if we carry out a similar calculation for the hard band , the xmm - newton point sources would produce @xmath34   count  s@xmath11 in xis . \n because this corresponds to only @xmath35  % of the actual xis count rate , suzaku  j14276051 is difficult to be explained by the sum of the sources and may be a truly diffuse source . \n we calculated the energy spectra of only x1 and of the summed spectra of the central seven point sources ( x1 through x7 ) . \n we made the response file and the ancillary response file using the sas tool rmfgen and arfgen , respectively . \n we fitted these spectra with the model of an absorbed power - law . \n because of the poor statistics , the photon index was fixed to 3.1 , which was determined by the spectral analysis of suzaku  j14276051 . \n the best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ tab : epicparm ] . \n figure  [ fig : epicspec ] shows the summed spectra of the seven point sources . \n the absorbed x - ray flux of the summed spectra was @xmath36 in the 210  kev band , which is about 5% of the flux derived with suzaku for suzaku  j14276051 . \n it is also found that the column density of the summed spectra is two orders of magnitude smaller than that derived for suzaku  j14276051 . \n these results confirm that suzaku  j14276051 can not be explained by the xmm - newton point sources . \n we discovered an apparently - diffuse hard x - ray source , suzaku  j14276051 with suzaku , and several point sources with xmm - newton in spatial coincidence with hess  j1427608 . \n we found that suzaku  j14276051 could not be explained by the sum of the point sources detected with xmm - newton , and concluded that it is a truly diffuse source . even if time variability of the detected point - like sources is considered , it is unlikely that suzaku  j14276051 is explained by them because the hydrogen column densities are quite different . \n the xmm - newton point sources are most likely foreground sources . to explain \n suzaku  j14276051 by the sum of several point sources would require that all those sources would be below detection threshold at the time of the xmm - newton observation , which appears very unlikely . \n thus , we concluded that suzaku  j14276051 is an intrinsically diffuse source and the x - ray counterpart of hess  j1427608 . \n we searched various catalogs and literature for the possible counterpart of hess  j1427608 in other wavebands . \n a gev gamma - ray source , 2fgl  j1427.66048c , is listed in the 2-year catalog of fermi ( @xcite ) . \n the gev source is located at @xmath37 , which is away from the center of hess  j1427608 ( see figure  [ fig : xisimage ] ) . since the error radius of the position is about , \n it may be associated with hess  j1427608 @xcite . however , \n this is a `` c - designator - applied '' \n fermi source whose position , emission characteristics , or even existence may not be reliable due to a potential confusion with interstellar emission @xcite . \n we believe it is premature to discuss a possible association of the gev source to hess  j1427608 ; future fermi data and analysis is necessary . \n we also searched the akari point source catalogues ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . \n no point source was found in the mid - infrared ( @xmath38 m ) and the far - infrared ( @xmath39 m ) bands within from the center of hess  j1427608 . \n although we mentioned hess  j1427608 as one of the most `` unlikely '' pwne in the introduction , its center - filled morphology and featureless spectrum in the x - ray band suggest that the source could be a pwn . \n thus we postulate here that the source is a pwn as a working hypothesis \n . figure  [ fig : wideband ] shows the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from x - rays to vhe gamma - rays . \n the estimated synchrotron spectra from the vhe gamma - ray spectrum @xcite , assuming that the same electron population would inverse - compton scatter cmb photons up to vhe gamma - rays and radiate synchrotron emission in x - rays , are also plotted with a local magnetic field @xmath40 of 1 , 3 , and 10@xmath41 . \n this sed plot indicates that the simple one - zone leptonic model with @xmath40 of about 5@xmath42 g would roughly explain both the x - ray and vhe gamma - ray data . in this context \n , the steep suzaku spectrum of @xmath43 could indicate that the suzaku energy band is higher than the cut - off energy . \n the inferred magnetic field strength of @xmath225@xmath42 g is within the range of typical values on the galactic plane . \n thus the sed is consistent with a one - zone leptonic model expected for pwne . \n we next examine the flux ratio and luminosities . the x - ray to vhe gamma - ray ratio is useful to probe the nature of unid sources @xcite . in the case of hess \n j1427608 , the unabsorbed x - ray flux @xmath44 of @xmath45 ( 210  kev ) and the vhe gamma - ray flux @xmath46 of @xmath47 ( 110 tev ) result in a flux ratio of @xmath48 . \n if we assume a distance to hess  j1427608 of @xmath49  kpc , the x - ray luminosity would be @xmath50 . \n the estimated flux ratio and x - ray luminosity are within the values of known x - ray and vhe gamma - ray emitting pwne , given that both values show a large scatter : @xmath51 in @xmath52 and @xmath53  erg  s@xmath11 in @xmath54 @xcite . \n thus the flux ratio and luminosity are also consistent with sources of pwn origin .    while there are observational evidences supporting the pwn origin as discussed above , others challenge such a view . with the assumption of @xmath49  kpc , \n the core size and whole radial extent would be 2  pc and 12  pc , respectively . \n the core size of 2  pc is a little large , but not exceptional among other pwn @xcite . \n the whole extent of 12  pc is not surprisingly large compared with the nebula of e.g. , psr  j18261334 @xcite . \n the largest drawback of the pwn hypothesis is lacking the detection of both a pulsar and radio pwn associated . \n it is known that the pulsar luminosity and its nebula luminosity in the x - ray band are correlated over 7 orders of magnitude @xcite . according to the correlation \n , the not - yet - detected pulsar should be brighter than @xmath55 in x - rays , one - tenth of the pwn luminosity . such a pulsar would have been easily detected with xmm - newton . \n in addition , the x - ray photon index of the nebula ( @xmath56 ) is very steep among the known x - ray nebulae most of which have a @xmath57 between 1.22.2 @xcite .    in terms of photon \n index comparison , non - thermal snrs might present a more plausible scenario than pwne . \n most of non - thermal snrs radiate synchrotron x - rays with a photon index of @xmath58 @xcite . \n the x - ray luminosity and extent are also compatible to synchrotron snrs @xcite . \n however , the facts that the source has a center - filled morphology in the x - ray band and no detection of the shell structure in the radio band hamper the interpretation as a non - thermal snr .    in summary , we have not reached a firm conclusion on the nature of hess  j1427608 . \n pwn and/or non - thermal snr , which are not necessary exclusive to each other , are the prime candidates but a decisive observational evidence is lacking . increasing statistics in fermi data \n may reveal a pulsation from 2fgl  j1427.66048c \n . a deep radio observation would also be helpful if it could detect pulsations or reveal the morphology of the source . \n we observed hess  j1427608 with suzaku , which is combined with the archival data analysis of xmm - newton , and obtained following results .    * \n we discovered an x - ray counterpart , suzaku  j14276051 , of hess  j1427608 . \n it is intrinsically extended ( @xmath59 ) and has a spectral shape of an absorbed power - law with a photon index of @xmath2 . \n * several faint point sources were found in spatial coincidence with hess  j1427608 using xmm - newton archival data in the soft x - ray band . * \n observational properties of suzaku  j14276051 and hess  j1427608 are compared with those of known pwne and non - thermal snrs . \n some properties favor the pwn and/or snr origin , but the available data are insufficient to draw firm conclusions . \n we thank kentaro  someya , yoshitomo  maeda and michito  sakai for their useful comments . \n t.f .  acknowledges the financial support from the global center of excellence program by mext , japan through the `` nanoscience and quantum physics '' project of the tokyo institute of technology , and jsps young research fellowship , no . \n 23 -

The direct detection of gravitational waves is crucial not only for gravitational wave astronomy but also as a probe for fundamental physics. Compact binary systems, such as neutron star binaries, are expected to be one of the most promising sources of gravitational waves. However, the direct detection of gravitational waves from such sources is challenging, and a complete set of templates is required to analyze the emitted waves. Numerical relativity is a powerful tool for calculating gravitational waves, but it has limitations. Perturbative approaches, such as the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli formalism, have been developed to mimic the coalescence of compact binary systems and have shown good agreement with numerical simulations. However, there are still few works on neutron star perturbations, and the quasinormal modes of a neutron star may have nothing to do with the final stage of the coalescence. Therefore, a perturbation analysis for a neutron star is also important. Thorne and Campolattaro derived perturbation equations for axial and polar modes of a spherically symmetric relativistic star. Lindblom, Mendell, and Ipser derived a couple of second-order differential equations, which could be interpreted as those for sound waves and gravitational waves, respectively. Quasinormal modes, if they exist, will be important in the analysis of gravitational waves from a compact binary. Kokkotas numerically calculated axial quasinormal modes for various ultracompact stars, and Kojima extended it to a slowly rotating star.

wheeler gauge to the transverse - traceless one , which metric near infinity is described as @xmath83 then the axial mode in transverse - traceless gauge at infinity turns out to be @xmath84 where the spin - weighted spherical harmonics @xmath85 is defined by @xmath86 the energy - momentum tensor of the gravitational waves at infinity is given by @xmath87 in the transverse - traceless gauge , where the angular brackets denote an appropriate average .    from this definition , \n we find the energy spectrum @xmath88 of gravitational waves at infinity for the axial mode as @xmath89 \n in this subsection , we consider a uniform density star . we restrict our analysis only to the case of the @xmath90 mode , just for simplicity . \n we find that features of the energy spectrum of emitted gravitational waves can be classified into two cases , which mainly depend on the shape of the effective potential . \n figure [ fig : potential ] shows the effective potential [ eqs . \n ( [ eq : inside_perturbation_equation_potential ] ) and ( [ eq : outside_perturbation_equation_potential ] ) ] for a uniform density star with three different compactness parameters @xmath91 . \n the effective potential has the following three features . \n first , the regge - wheeler potential [ eq . \n ( [ eq : outside_perturbation_equation_potential ] ) ] has a maximum point near @xmath92 ( accurately at @xmath93 for @xmath94 ) . \n second , the potential is discontinuous at the surface because of a discontinuity of the energy density of the star at the surface . \n finally , a potential minimum appears inside the star , if the star is ultracompact ( for the case of @xmath0 ) .    according to the last feature \n , we study two cases separately . \n the first stellar type is the case that the surface is outside the potential barrier ( @xmath95 ) . for a usual neutron star , @xmath96 , and \n then the first type is most likely a realistic astronomical object . \n the second stellar type is the case that the surface is inside the potential barrier ( @xmath97 ) , which may be an exotic star , if it exists . \n first we show our result for the first type . for the case of @xmath98 \n , we show the energy spectra of emitted gravitational waves in fig . \n [ fig : rm5 ] . in this figure \n , there exists only a single peak in each spectrum . \n this peak corresponds to the orbital frequency of a test particle at the turning point , i.e. , periastron . \n this means that most gravitational waves are emitted around the turning point , where the effect of the gravitational field is the strongest . \n no other feature is found in this spectrum . \n in fact , fixing the energy @xmath99 and orbital angular momentum @xmath100 , the spectrum depends less on the compactness parameter @xmath91 ( see fig . [ \n fig : rm5bh ] ) . for a black hole background \n , we find quite similar behaviors in the energy spectrum ( fig . \n [ fig : rm5bh ] ) , except for the high frequency region , where the difference of the boundary conditions is crucial . \n we also find that the spectrum approaches closer to that of a black hole as the star gets smaller . \n we also calculate the waveform for the case of @xmath101 and black holes , respectively . \n we see that a burst wave due to the encounter of a test particle emerges for each case . as the same as the energy spectrum , the difference between these waveform is very little ( see fig . \n [ fig : wf5 ] )    therefore , for the first stellar type of @xmath102 , the energy spectrum largely depends on the trajectory , but not on the background object . \n next we discuss an ultracompact star , which shows much more various structure in the spectrum . in this case \n , a minimum point of the effective potential appears inside the star . as for the trajectory of a test particle , we have two possibilities : one is that the particle gets into the inside region beyond the potential barrier and the other is that one passes through outside the barrier . since the particle approaches closer to the star , it feels a stronger gravitational field . as a result , \n the excitation by the particle is more efficient and the emitted gravitational waves are enhanced . as a numerical example , we show those energy spectra for the model with radius @xmath103 with the turning points @xmath104 and @xmath105 in fig . [ \n fig : rm2.26 ] .    apart from a global maximum , which appears in the first type model as well and corresponds to the orbital frequency of a test particle at the turning point \n , we also find many small periodic peaks in fig . \n [ fig : rm2.26 ] . \n this microscopic peak structure is classified into two types , which are divided at the frequency of the maximum @xmath106 ( @xmath107 for @xmath94 ) of the effective potential . in the lower frequency region ( @xmath108 ) \n , small and sharp peaks correspond to the quasinormal modes , as we will show it next . for the higher frequency region ( @xmath109 ) , we find small periodic peaks , which may appear because of a resonance between two potential barriers . \n we will also discuss this later .    in order to analyze our numerical results \n , we first have to know the axial quasinormal modes . our method to calculate a quasinormal mode \n is based on the continued fraction expansion method which was originally used for black holes by leaver @xcite , and adopted for the polar mode of a spherical star by leins , nollert , and soffel @xcite . \n we apply this method to axial modes as well . \n we show our results in table [ tab : qnm_urm2.26 ] with those of kokkotas@xcite whose method is different from ours . \n the table shows that both results agree quite well .    in fig . \n [ fig : rm2.26qnm ] , we present both the quasinormal mode and energy spectrum . as seen from fig . \n [ fig : rm2.26qnm ] , axial \n quasinormal \" modes are classified into two : the lower frequency mode ( @xmath110 ) , which imaginary part is very small @xmath111 , and the higher frequency mode ( @xmath112 ) , which imaginary part is rather large @xmath113 . \n the reason is very simple . for a frequency lower than @xmath114 \n , we can have a quasibound state . \n since trapped waves tunnel through the potential barrier , the energy will decrease . \n it is similar to the quasinormal mode of a black hole . \n then , we may call it the axial quasinormal mode as well . however , if the frequency is higher than @xmath114 , we have no bound state . \n nevertheless , we can find the \n quasinormal \" mode , by which we mean a wave solution with the same boundary condition as that of the conventional quasinormal mode , which is the outgoing wave condition . in the present case , although we find such wave solutions , those waves decay very quickly because the frequency is higher than the potential barrier . \n this is the reason why we find a large imaginary part of the mode frequency . \n the solutions which satisfy the boundary condition appear periodically as seen from fig . \n [ fig : rm2.26qnm ] . \n we find that the frequencies of these quasinormal modes coincide with those of spectrum peaks in the frequency region lower than @xmath114 . \n this is because a test particle excites those quasinormal modes . \n in fact , when we see the waveform ( fig . [ \n fig : wf2.26 ] ) , the wave consists of two parts : large one , which corresponds to the burst wave by the encounter by a test particle , and the other part with several oscillations , which comes from exited quasinormal modes in the spectrum . \n actually the waveform in the region after @xmath115 in fig . \n [ fig : wf2.26 ] is similar to kokkotas s result for a gaussian pulse wave @xcite .    on the other hand , in a frequency region \n higher than @xmath114 , although many periodic peaks appear , those positions are not exactly the same as the frequencies of  quasinormal \" modes . \n we may understand this fact as follows . \n even if the wave frequency @xmath116 is higher than the potential barrier , the reflection coefficient does not vanish and oscillates with respect to @xmath116 , which period is determined by the potential form . in the present case , we have also an infinite wall near the center of a star . \n we then expect that small periodic peaks appearing in the spectrum are due to an interference between the incoming and outgoing waves reflected by two potential barriers . \n since these waves decay very quickly as mentioned above , the process is quite dynamical , and then the peaks in the spectrum do not coincide with the frequencies of  quasinormal \" modes .    in fig . \n [ fig : rm2.26 - 2.3 ] , we show the energy spectra for two stellar models with @xmath117 , and @xmath118 , which correspond to the cases that the turning point is inside and outside the barrier , respectively . for fixed energy @xmath119 and angular momentum @xmath100 \n , the global peaks corresponding to the orbital frequency at the turning point agree with each other . on the other hand , the other small periodic peaks from the excited quasinormal modes do not agree with and rather depend on the compactness parameter @xmath91 . consequently , from the analysis of the energy spectrum of axial modes , we may determine the compactness parameter @xmath91 of an ultracompact star . \n we can also compare a black hole and an ultracompact star . in fig . \n [ fig : rm2.26bh ] , we show the energy spectra both for a black hole @xcite and an ultracompact star with @xmath120 . from fig . \n [ fig : rm2.26bh ] , we see that even for the case of a schwarzschild black hole , the global peak due to the orbital motion of the particle coincides with that for the star . however , unlike the stellar model , \n no small periodic peaks appear in the case of a black hole . \n in fact for a black hole , there is no peak after @xmath115 ( see fig . \n this is because the effective potential of the star has an infinite potential wall near the center , which guarantees the existence of quasinormal modes , while that of a schwarzschild black hole has no such wall , and incoming waves fall entirely into the event horizon @xmath121 . \n hence , we can also distinguish a background object , i.e. , whether it is an ultracompact star or a black hole , analyzing only axial modes . \n as for the total energy of emitted gravitational waves @xmath122 , we find @xmath123 with @xmath124 and @xmath125 for @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively , and for @xmath128 and @xmath129 . \n the efficiency @xmath130 increases monotonically as the compactness gets smaller , and seems to end up with that for schwarzschild black holes ( @xmath131 ) . for @xmath132 and @xmath133 , the efficiency , which is @xmath134 , \n little depends on @xmath135 up to the case of a black hole .      from the analysis of the energy spectrum for a uniform density star , we find that the spectrum strongly depends on the shape of effective potential . therefore , \n it may be important to see the dependence of the equation of state on the energy spectrum . then , in this section , we study a polytropic star . just for simplicity \n , we use the newtonian polytropic equation of state as @xmath136 where @xmath137 is a polytropic index and @xmath138 is a constant value .    first , we consider the first type stellar model with @xmath139 . \n we set the polytropic index @xmath140 and the constant @xmath141 , and choose the central energy density @xmath142 . \n this choice gives a stellar model with mass @xmath143 and radius @xmath144 . \n the compact parameter is @xmath145 , and then the surface locates outside the peak of the regge - wheeler potential . \n we show the energy spectra of gravitational waves from a scattering test particle in fig . \n [ fig : polytropic1.0 ] . \n we find the same feature as that for the uniform density star with @xmath146 , i.e. , there is only a single global peak which frequency corresponds to the orbital one of the particle at the turning point . \n next , we discuss the second type stellar model , i.e. , an ultracompact star . to construct an ultracompact star with a polytropic equation of state \n , we set the polytropic index @xmath147 , the constant @xmath148 , and choose the central energy density @xmath149 , for which the compactness parameter @xmath135 turns out to be the smallest . \n for such a choice , the radius , mass , and compactness parameters of the star are @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and @xmath152 , respectively . \n although this seems very implausible for a realistic star , we will use this solution in our analysis to study the dependence of the equation of state on the energy spectrum . in fig . \n [ fig : polytropic0.5 ] , we show the energy spectra for two trajectories of a test particle . \n one is the case that a particle goes into the inside of the potential barrier , while the other is the case that a particle passes through only outside the potential barrier . \n we find the same feature as that of the uniform density star with @xmath153 . \n the difference is found in the frequencies of quasinormal modes because of the different shapes of the potential . \n then , we find many small and sharp peaks in the spectrum at the positions different from those for a uniform density star . \n consequently , we may be able to distinguish the inside structure of an ultracompact star by observing the energy spectrum of emitted gravitational waves . \n we have studied the axial modes of gravitational waves from a test particle scattered by a spherically symmetric relativistic star . \n we have considered both a uniform density star and a polytropic star . \n we find that the energy spectrum depends mainly on the shape of the effective potential for gravitational waves , i.e. , whether its minimum exists or not . \n when there is no minimum ( e.g. , a regular type of neutron star with a compactness parameter @xmath154 ) , the energy spectrum shows only a single global peak , which corresponds to the orbital frequency of a test particle at the turning point . \n gravitational waves are mostly emitted around the turning point , where the effect of the gravitational field is strongest .    while if a minimum of the effective potential exists ( i.e. , some exotic relativistic star with small compactness parameter @xmath155 ) , the energy spectrum shows a variety in its structure in addition to the global peak as the same as that found in the previous case . \n we find small and sharp periodic peaks in the region lower than @xmath114 ( the maximum value of the effective potential ) , which correspond to an excitation of the axial quasinormal modes . \n the existence of the potential minimum allows the existence of a quasibound state of gravitational waves , i.e. , quasinormal modes . \n then those modes are excited by a scattered particle . \n this becomes more conspicuous when the particle gets into the inside region beyond the potential barrier . \n we also find small periodic peaks in the frequency region beyond @xmath114 , which may come from an interference between two waves reflected by the potential barrier and the infinite wall near the center of the star .    from the observation of the energy spectrum of the axial mode , \n what we can determine ? naively speaking , we may not find any information about the constituent of the star , because the axial mode does not couple to matter fluid . \n this is true for the first type stellar model , i.e. , a regular neutron star . emitted gravitational waves \n are mostly determined by the particle orbit . \n the case of black holes also belongs to this case , although there is a small difference in the high frequency part because of the difference of the boundary condition . \n however , if a star is compact enough to make a potential minimum ( @xmath156 ) , emitted gravitational waves show much more abundant information . \n it may determine a compactness parameter @xmath91 . \n we also find quasinormal mode frequencies , which depend on the shape of the potential , and then could depend on the equation of state .    in the axial mode case , however , in general , we can not have direct information about the matter fluid , in particular about the equation of state . \n the polar mode of gravitational waves will provide us a more conspicuous dependence of matter property . \n work on the polar modes is under way . \n we would like to thank yasufumi kojima for kind suggestions at the beginning of this study . \n the numerical computations were mainly performed by the fujitsu - vx vector computer at the media network center , waseda university . \n this work was supported partially by a jsps grant - in - aid ( no . 5689 and specially promoted research no . \n 08102010 ) , and by the waseda university grant for special research projects . \n here , we present numerical techniques solving the wave equations . \n we improved borrelli s method@xcite to guarantee numerical accuracy . \n for the interior region , the numerical error of the wave function accumulates and becomes maximal at the surface , because the pressure vanishes there . in order to overcome this difficulty , we solve the wave equation both from the center and from the surface , and connect two wave functions at some inner point , e.g. , \n @xmath157 . for the exterior solution \n , we integrate the wave equation from the surface to infinity , by which we can reduce the numerical error . in the present model , \n the test particle mainly emits gravitational waves at the turning point , where we have to solve the wave equation very carefully because an apparent divergence appears . \n we shall discuss these three methods in order . \n here we show how to solve the interior wave equation ( [ eq : inside_perturbation_equation ] ) . transforming the wave function @xmath33 to @xmath158 \n we find the perturbation equation for @xmath159 as @xmath160 \\frac{dz_{l\\omega}}{dr } + e^{\\lambda -

However, for an ultracompact star (the radius @xmath0), another type of resonant periodic peak appears in the spectrum. This is just because of an excitation by a scattered particle of axial quasinormal modes, which were found by chandrasekhar and ferrari.

correlation between two different time snapshots . \n obtained ( time - averaged ) examples of the velocity field are shown by colored vectors in figs . \n [ fig : vector_and_vertical_plot ] and [ fig : vectorplot ] . an interval time to compute the velocity ( cross - correlation ) \n is kept constant so that it corresponds to a multiple of the period of vibration , i.e. , two cross - correlated images are kept in same phase . \n for instance , @xmath42 s time interval is used for @xmath43 hz vibration . \n if we use a full temporal resolution to calculate the velocity field , vibrational motion of individual grains can be captured just like @xcite measurement . \n however , we are mainly interested in the global convective motion rather than such microscopic vibration . therefore , we use phase - matching images to compute the velocity .            as shown in fig . \n [ fig : vector_and_vertical_plot ] , convective - velocity vectors are decomposed into @xmath44 ( vertical ) and @xmath45 ( horizontal ) directions . \n they are averaged along the horizontal axis since we are mainly focusing on the axisymmetric convective flow ( like fig . \n [ fig : vector_and_vertical_plot ] ) for the reason mentioned later \n . then we obtain vertical and horizontal components of velocities as functions of @xmath44 , respectively as , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in fig . \n [ fig : vector_and_vertical_plot ] , panels ( b ) and ( c ) respectively show @xmath46 and @xmath47 computed from the velocity field shown in panel ( a ) . the positive direction of @xmath44 axis is taken to downward , and @xmath48 corresponds to the top surface of the granular bed . \n @xmath49 is the center of container . above the surface of granular bed ( @xmath50 ) , \n saltations of grains are dominant and the measured velocity becomes random . \n this is the reason of large errors in @xmath51 and @xmath52 at @xmath50 ( fig . \n [ fig : vector_and_vertical_plot](b , c ) ) . \n first , we are going to focus on the global structure of the granular convective motion . \n we find that the global structure shows a transition from a single roll to a toroidal roll as @xmath10 increases . in the former state , \n grains rise up on the one side wall and fall down on the opposite side wall . \n thus , in this state , the resultant velocity field shows a certain circularity . due to this circularity , \n a gradient of the velocity field is observed as shown in fig . \n [ fig : vectorplot](a ) . in this single -

@xmath79 ) is scaled by @xmath11 . \n the range of @xmath11 we used in this study is slightly different from that in the previous studies . in @xcite , \n @xmath11 was used to characterize the onset of convection in the strongly shaken shallow granular bed . in this study \n , we experimentally confirm that @xmath11 is also useful to the scaling analysis of the convective velocity in a weakly shaken thick granular bed . \n the range of @xmath11 for our experiment is from @xmath80 to @xmath81 . \n although the order of this regime is about one order of magnitude smaller than that in the experiment of  @xcite ( @xmath82 ) , the current experimental result is also well explained by @xmath11 .     by @xmath7 . \n each open symbol shows the data of glass beads bed of @xmath27 mm , @xmath55 mm , and @xmath54 mm . \n while a systematic correlation between @xmath75 and @xmath7 can be observed , a universal form can not be obtained solely by @xmath7 scaling.,title=\"fig : \" ]     by @xmath11 . \n colors and markers used are identical to those in fig . \n [ fig : g_scaling ] . \n the dashed line represents the power law fit ( eqs . \n ( [ eq : fitting ] ) ) . the slope ( power ) of the dashed line \n is computed as @xmath77 . \n the solid line corresponds to @xmath78 which is obtained by the least square search for all the data including various system size parameters ( fig . \n [ fig : sl_scaling ] ) . \n , title=\"fig : \" ]    as a next step of the scaling , we investigate the system size dependence of @xmath75 by the varying geometric parameters : bed height @xmath83 and its radius @xmath15 . in fig . \n [ fig : aspect_ratio ] , the data of @xmath75 vs.  @xmath84 for various @xmath7 and @xmath10 are shown . \n non - axisymmetric convection patterns such as a single - roll state are sometimes found in the experiment at some @xmath84 . due to the inhomogeneity , \n the representative velocities in these states show extremely large dispersion . \n since we restrict ourselves within the analysis of representative velocity in the homogeneous convection , these data are excluded from the analysis . as shown in fig . \n [ fig : aspect_ratio ] , we find that @xmath75 is roughly independent of @xmath84 although its specific value clearly depends on vibrational conditions ( @xmath7 and @xmath10 ) . \n this simple relation @xmath85 suggests that @xmath75 can be scaled equivalently both by @xmath15 and @xmath83 . \n namely , @xmath75 is the increasing function both of @xmath15 and @xmath83 \n . then we can reduce the number of geometric parameters , i.e. , @xmath15 and @xmath83 can be unified into a single parameter . in specific , a dimensionless parameter for the system size @xmath86 can be introduced by using grains diameter @xmath13 as , @xmath87     to the aspect ratio of the shaken granular bed , @xmath84 . \n colors and shapes of markers indicate vibrational conditions as denoted in the legend . \n all the data points are originated from the experiments with glass beads of @xmath27 mm ( bz08 ) . \n we remove the data of single - roll state from this plot . \n although the level of @xmath75 depends on vibrational conditions , it is roughly independent of @xmath84 . \n dashed lines are the average levels for each condition.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to prove the validity of the dimensionless parameter @xmath86 , @xmath13 should be varied as well as @xmath15 and @xmath83 . \n therefore , we also examine the @xmath13 dependence of @xmath88 . for this purpose , \n the aspect ratio is fixed ( @xmath54 mm and @xmath55 mm ) and glass beads of @xmath28 mm ( bz04 ) and @xmath89 mm ( bz2 ) are used in the experiment . while @xmath75 of bz04 is in the same order as the bz08 case \n , @xmath75 of bz2 is about one order of magnitude smaller than that of bz08 , under the same vibrational condition . \n this is due to the effect of crystallization which prevents the convective motion . \n besides , the solidification ( complete crystallization ) of glass beads bed occurs when bz2 is shaken by @xmath90 . \n the crystallization is unavoidable for the larger grains as long as we use nearly mono - disperse spherical grains . whereas the number of data points is not enough to discuss the specific scaling form \n , we qualitatively confirm that the convective velocity is a decreasing function of @xmath13 . \n altogether , we can assume a simple scaling relation among these dimensionless parameters to compile all the data . \n the assumed scaling form is written as , @xmath91 the values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 are computed by searching the least square point in the range of @xmath94 and @xmath95 . \n the least square fitting in fig . \n ( [ fig : sl_scaling ] ) is computed with weighting of the standard deviation ( velocity scattering degree ) . \n the obtained values are @xmath78 and @xmath96 . \n and the computed numerical prefactor is @xmath97 . \n the scaling result for all the experimentally obtained data is shown in fig .  [ \n fig : sl_scaling ] . \n as can be seen , the data are basically well scaled by the variable @xmath98 . the corresponding scaling line ( @xmath99 ) \n is also plotted in fig . \n [ fig : s_scaling ] as a solid line . \n the value of @xmath92 is slightly improved from the fixed system size case ( fig . \n ( [ fig : s_scaling ] ) ) . in fig . \n [ fig : sl_scaling ] , two data points deviate significantly from the scaling . \n this deviation comes from the crystallization effect of large glass beads ( bz2 ) . \n the inset of fig . \n [ fig : sl_scaling ] shows a linear plot of the same data . \n this scaling relation is the main result of this experimental investigation . \n there are some missing parameters in the scaling of eq . \n ( [ eq : sl_scaling ] ) . for example \n , density is not involved in it . \n that is , the scaling is a kind of kinematic one . \n the density dependence has to be clarified to understand the dynamic scaling including the effect of inertia  @xcite . \n perhaps , this would not be so critical because the density of glass beads ( @xmath30 kg / m@xmath31 ) is close to ( at least in the same order with ) the real regolith density ( e.g. , @xmath100 kg / m@xmath31 for itokawa  @xcite ) . \n another example of the missing parameters is the cohesive force among grains . \n although the gravitational force is very small on the surface of small asteroids , the cohesive effect would instead play a crucial role  @xcite . \n it is hard to check this effect by the current experiment since we do not vary the cohesiveness of grains . in the current experiment , \n the cohesive force is negligible since it is much smaller than the gravitational force . \n we assume that interstitial air and electrostatic effects do not play essential roles , i.e. , they are much smaller than gravity effect . indeed , the air effect is negligible as long as we use @xmath101 mm grains ( see e.g. , supplementary information of @xcite ) . \n we also think that the gravitational force is more dominant than the electrostatic force for the bulk convective motion of glass beads . \n in fact , while we saw a few glass beads sticking on the sidewall due to the electrostatic effect , those were really few . the electrostatic effect might slightly affect the convective motion . \n however , we consider it can not be a dominant effect . \n a much more serious problem is the absence of frictional properties in the scaling . \n the frictional properties are a possible origin of intermittent velocity fluctuation shown in fig . \n [ fig : time_changing ] . \n in addition , it might affect the representative value of convective velocity . \n frictional properties relate to the shape of constitutive grains . obviously , actual regolith grains shapes are irregular and rough . by a preliminary experiment \n , we actually confirm that @xmath58 significantly reduces when the rough - shaped sand grains are used . on the contrary \n , some previous studies have reported that the friction can enhance the convective velocity  @xcite . moreover , \n the grain - wall friction is different from grain - grain friction . \n the grain - wall friction could be a reason of the onset of granular convection in this experiment . \n the detailed study for the effect of friction is a very important future problem . \n the origin of granular convection in the current experiment is plausibly the effect of wall . as already mentioned , the structure of the convective roll changes spontaneously when @xmath10 or @xmath15 are varied \n this implies that there is an inherent length scale in the granular convection . \n however , the wall effect to the velocity scaling is still significant even in split ( doubled ) roll state since we observe the grains motion on the wall . \n moreover , it has been shown that experimental conditions including the container s shape and interstitial air influence the convective roll structure  @xcite . in these previous studies \n , the interaction between grains and wall seems to be a key factor . \n nevertheless , astronomical objects obviously maintain their own shapes without any wall . \n it is hard to eliminate the container wall effect in usual granular experiments even in microgravity environment . \n rather , highly heterogenous structure of small asteroids might work as an effective wall which triggers the granular convection . \n put another way , there could be a lot of effective boundaries and/or gradients of frictional properties in actual small asteroids . \n thus it is not quite clear whether the granular convection occurs globally or locally in small asteroids . \n the structure of the velocity profile @xmath46 is informative both for the granular physics and planetary science . in the previous studies of granular convection  @xcite \n , convective velocity decays rapidly ( exponentially ) with depth . \n and the deep region of the vibrated granular matter is almost at rest . \n if this peculiar regime called _ frozen zone _ presents in the real asteroids convection , the regolith migration occurs only within a shallow region . in the current experiment , \n most of velocity profiles do not show the clear frozen zone . \n the convective velocity decays calmly as typically shown in fig . \n [ fig : vector_and_vertical_plot](b ) . \n thus the convective velocity is simply scaled by @xmath86 with the nontrivial exponent @xmath102 . \n if the frozen zone is clearly observed , the convective velocity would be saturated at a certain @xmath83 , and it can not be simply scaled by a single exponent . actually , the frozen zone can be partially observed also in the current experiment under small @xmath7 , large @xmath10 , and large @xmath83 conditions . \n since we are interested in the principal flow velocity of the granular convection , we have focused only on the axisymmetric convective state and its maximum velocity @xmath58 , in this study . \n detailed analysis of @xmath46 profile is a next important step to reveal the granular convection dynamics that relates to the depth of regolith convection occurring in small astronomical objects . \n so far , the scaling form for the granular convective velocity has been discussed on the basis of systematically performed experimental results . in this subsection \n , we discuss the implication of the obtained scaling law . \n the scaling of eq . \n ( [ eq : sl_scaling ] ) can be rewritten by considering its physical meaning . \n then the scaling is compared with a recent experimental result of two - dimensional granular convection . \n equation  ( [ eq : sl_scaling ] ) can be transformed into a following form , @xmath103 this form is more understandable than eq . \n ( [ eq : sl_scaling ] ) . \n the representative velocity @xmath58 is expressed by a power law product of two characteristic velocities : gravitational @xmath104 and vibrational @xmath105 . \n in addition , the system size dependence is scaled by the last factor @xmath106 . \n the scaling of eq . \n ( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) is qualitatively consistent with a recent experiment performed by  @xcite . \n they investigated the convective - driven bne and found that the convective velocity linearly depends on @xmath105 . \n to better explain the experimental data , the use of @xmath105 was much better than @xmath7 . according to eq . \n ( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) , convective velocity depends on vibrational velocity as , @xmath107 . \n these two experimental results show a good agreement . however , they reported the presence of critical vibrational velocity below which the granular convection was not induced . \n this critical vibrational velocity probably corresponds to the onset criterion . in the current analysis \n , however , we do not clearly confirm this offset in the scaling ( see fig . \n [ fig : sl_scaling ] ) . \n instead , we varied @xmath11 over two orders of magnitude to obtain the power - law relation . \n the range of @xmath11 and other parameters were relatively narrow in the study of @xcite since they are not interested in the scale - free form . \n thus they reported the linear relation between the convective velocity and the vibrational velocity . on the other hand \n , we obtain the scaling ( power law ) relation between the convective velocity , the vibrational velocity , and the gravitational velocity . \n it should be noted that the system size dependence of the scaling is bounded . according to eq . \n ( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) , the value of @xmath58 can be very large when @xmath108 becomes large . \n this condition corresponds to a large @xmath109 or a small @xmath13 case . at the limit of @xmath110 or @xmath111 \n , @xmath58 diverges . \n however , such a divergence does not occur in the actual granular convection . \n the convective roll size can not grow to the infinitely large size . \n in fact , we experimentally observed the split of the convective roll ( double toroidal - roll ) in a very shallow layer , although such a split rarely happened . \n this preliminary observation indicates that there might be an intrinsic length scale which determines the maximum convective roll size . \n since the current experimental system size is limited , it is hard to systematically reveal the effect of this intrinsic length scale . at a small @xmath13 regime , \n on the other hand , the cohesive force among grains becomes dominant instead of the gravitational force . \n the current scaling form can not be applied to such a situation . \n the detailed investigation on the size - dependent scaling form for more widely spreading size regime is an important future problem . to investigate the small @xmath13 regime , \n the experiment under the vacuum condition is also necessary . \n finally , the experimentally obtained scaling is cast into a form in which the gravity effect can be directly evaluated . \n since the interpretation of scaling is not unique in general , we have to take a special care for its understanding . whereas the discussion in this subsection is speculative , the result is consistent with other related works . \n moreover , the obtained scaling includes various parameters such as vibration frequency and system size . \n thus the form is very efficient to estimate the timescale of regolith convection occurring on the surface of small asteroid . \n recently , some granular flow experiments were performed under microgravity conditions created by parabolic flights  @xcite . \n @xcite used a taylor - couette geometry and measured both sheared and convective flows induced by the shearing . \n particularly , @xcite reported the effect of gravity to the sheared granular convection . \n they claimed that the gravity plays an essential role to make a stiff grains network in a bulk granular matter . \n such a grains network is necessary to transform a shear stress into a driving force of the convective motion . \n therefore , the granular convective velocity under the microgravity became almost zero . \n moreover , the convective velocity under the high - gravity condition became large  @xcite . \n @xcite measured the rising velocity of intruders in convective - driven bne under the reduced gravity . \n they found that the rising velocity is almost linearly scaled by the gravity .    to compare the current result with above - mentioned microgravity experiments , \n here we evaluate the gravity influence to the convective velocity based on eq . \n ( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) . at a glance of eq . \n ( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) , the convective velocity is scaled as @xmath112 . \n this scaling implicitly assumes the fixed @xmath105 under different @xmath1 environment . \n this assumption is not practical to estimate the granular convective velocity induced under the different @xmath1 . \n for instance , under the microgravity environment , very small vibrational acceleration is enough to satisfy the onset criterion of granular convection ( @xmath113 ) . however , if @xmath105 is fixed to consider the granular convective velocity under the microgravity environment , the corresponding @xmath7 becomes extremely large . \n it is not a realistic assumption . instead \n , the value of @xmath7 should be fixed to estimate the convective velocity by means of similarity law . \n in fact , fixed @xmath7 was used to discuss the possibility of convection on the surface of itokawa  @xcite . @xcite \n also fixed @xmath7 to discuss @xmath1 dependence . \n therefore , the typical vibrational velocity should be written as @xmath114 instead of @xmath105 . \n then , eq .  ( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) can be modified into the following form , @xmath115 according to eq . \n ( [ eq : scaling2 ] ) , @xmath58 depends on @xmath1 as , @xmath116 . \n the value @xmath117 is close to unity . \n this result is qualitatively similar to @xcite and @xcite . \n however , note that we do not directly vary the gravitational acceleration . \n the @xmath1 dependence is indirectly deduced from the scaling . besides , the convective motion of  @xcite was induced by shear in a taylor - couette cell . thus the similarity is rather qualitative . \n using eq . \n ( [ eq : scaling2 ] ) and a model of seismic shaking induced by impacts  @xcite , we are able to estimate the convective velocity for various astronomical objects . \n to do that , we have to be careful in the estimate of @xmath106 . \n whereas its value strongly affects the estimate of @xmath58 , it is still very uncertain \n . then it might be possible to evaluate the surface age ( resurfacing timescale ) of the microgravity asteroid by considering the population of impactors . \n such an estimate for itokawa or eros is an interesting application of this scaling . \n this topic is a part of ongoing investigation . \n an experimental study of the granular convection was performed with a vertically shaken glass beads bed . \n the maximum convective velocity @xmath58 was measured by piv method . \n although the @xmath58 was measured on the wall , we assume that it corresponds to a representative value of the convective velocity . \n the normalized convective velocity @xmath118 was scaled by the shaking parameter @xmath119 and the dimensionless system size @xmath108 . \n the obtained scaling ( eq  ( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) ) indicates that the representative convective velocity can be written as a certain power - law product of the vibrational velocity @xmath105 , the gravitational velocity @xmath104 , and the dimensionless system size @xmath86 . \n this experimentally obtained scaling law is qualitatively consistent with other previous studies of granular convection or bne . using the scaling law \n , one can roughly estimate the convective velocity for various vibrational conditions , in principle . since the gravitational acceleration and frictional properties \n are not varied in this experiment , applicability of the current result toward actual regolith migration might be still limited . \n systematic further studies have to be carried out to unveil the regolith migration dynamics owing to the granular convection . \n we would like to thank to s. watanabe , h. kumagai , s. sirono , and t. morota for fruitful discussions and suggestions . this research has been partly supported by jsps kakenhi grant number 23654134 and nagoya university program for leading graduate schools ( leadership development program for space exploration and research ) . \n 39 natexlab#1#1[1]`#1 ` [ 2]#2 [ 1]#1 [ 1]http://dx.doi.org/#1 [ ] [ 1]pmid:#1 [ ] [ 2]#2 , , , , , , , , , , , , , . . , \n , , , , . . , . , , , \n . . , . , , , ( eds . ) , . . \n , , , . . , \n , , , , , , . . , \n , , , , , , . . , . , , , , , \n , , , , . . , \n . , . . , . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , \n . . , . , , , , \n , , , , . . , \n , , , , . . , \n , , , , , , , , , , , . . , \n . , . . , . , , \n , , , , , , . . , \n , , , . . , \n , , , , , . . , \n , , , . . , \n , , , , . . , \n , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . . , \n , , , , , , a. . , . \n , , , , , , , b. . , . \n , , , , , , , c. . , . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . . , \n , , , . . , \n , , , , , . . , \n , , , . . , \n , , , , . . , \n , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . . , \n , , , , . . , \n . , . . , . , , , , , \n . . , . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , \n . . , . , , , , ,", "human_aspect": "{\n  \"background\": \"we experimentally study the velocity scaling of granular convection which is a possible mechanism of the regolith migration on the surface of small asteroids.

ica , @xcite ) , nonnegative matrix factorization ( nmf , @xcite ) , sparse space - time deconvolution ( sstd , @xcite ) and constrained nonnegative matrix factorization ( cnmf , @xcite ) . in particular , pca - ica seeks spatiotemporal components that have reduced dependence . \n it is an inherently linear demixing method and can fail in the case when the neural components exhibit significant spatial overlaps ( @xcite ) . \n nonlinear methods like nmf , sstd and cnmf can deal with overlapping neural sources more effectively , and often outperform pca - ica . \n the main applications of these nonlinear methods are 2-photon or light - sheet imaging data , where the background is weak and has simple spatiotemporally separable structure . \n they usually model the background with a rank-1 nonnegative matrix . \n however , applying these nonlinear matrix factorization methods to the microendoscopic data faces two problems : ( 1 ) the background term is not well modeled by rank-1 nmf and its large residual could contaminate the extracted neuronal signals ; ( 2 ) the procedures of initializing the model parameters , especially spatial and temporal components of neurons , in these models do not work well because the strong and noisy background mixes with the weak neural signals . \n since the optimization problem in these methods are non - convex , without good initialization , it may lead to low - quality results or require excessive time for convergent results .      in this paper , we extend the cnmf framework ( @xcite ) to address strong fluctuations in background fluorescence , and make it applicable to microendoscopic data . \n like the proposed cnmf in @xcite , our extended cnmf for microendoscopic data ( cnmf - e ) also has the capability of identifying neurons with low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and simultaneously denoising , deconvolving and demixing large - scale microendoscopic data . to accomplish this : ( 1 ) we replace the rank-1 nmf approximation of the background with a more sophisticated approximation , which can better account the complex background and avoid absorbing cellular signals , and ( 2 ) we develop an efficient initialization procedure to extract neural activities with minimal influence from the background . \n the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : cnmf ] \n we briefly review the cnmf model and describe our modifications to the model . in section [ sec : fit_model ] \n , we develop our specialized model fitting procedure . in section [ sec : result ] we validate our new proposed cnmf -

step @xmath4 . \n we use @xmath5 to refer the spatial location of one pixel , thus @xmath6 is the fluorescence intensity in @xmath4-th frame at location @xmath7 . for a column vector @xmath8 encoding the spatial information of @xmath1 pixels , @xmath9 indicates the value of @xmath10 at pixel @xmath7 . \n the video data we have are observations from the optical field for a total number of @xmath2 frames . \n the recorded data can be represented by a matrix @xmath11 , where @xmath1 is the number of pixels in the field . \n each neuron is characterized by its spatial ` footprint ' vector @xmath12 and ` calcium activity ' @xmath13 . here \n both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are forced to be nonnegative because of their physical interpretations . \n given @xmath16 of one neuron , its spatiotemporal activity is represented as @xmath17 . \n the background activity is represented by a matrix @xmath18 . \n suppose the field contains a total number of @xmath19 neurons , then the observation is a superposition of all neurons spatiotemporal activity , time - varying background and additive noise : @xmath20 where @xmath21 , c=[\\mathbf{c}_1 , \\cdots , \\mathbf{c}_k]^t$ ] . \n the noise term @xmath22 is assumed to be gaussian and @xmath23 . \n @xmath24 is a diagonal matrix indicating that the noise is spatially and temporally uncorrelated . \n @xcite also explicitly model the calcium dynamics @xmath15 with a stable autoregressive process ( ar ) of order @xmath25 , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of spikes that neuron fired at the @xmath4-th frame and it is sparse in the neural systems . \n the ar coefficients @xmath28 are different for each neuron and they are estimated from the data .    estimating the model parameters @xmath29 in model ( [ eq : y])([eq : arp ] ) can give us all neurons spatial footprints and their deconvolved temporal activities . to fit the model , we also have to constrain the background term to have simplified structure , otherwise letting @xmath30 leads to the least reconstruction error . \n this framework is general and we use it in our new method as well . \n compared with the proposed implementation in @xcite , our method models the background term differently .    in the work of @xcite , they model the background with a rank-1 nonnegative matrix @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 encode the background spatial and temporal structure respectively \n this is a good assumption for two - photon or light - sheet imaging data , but the background in microendoscopic data requires a more complex model . \n we also have to avoid the increased complexity from absorbing cellular signals into the background . \n thus the ideal model should explicitly model the background features that are distinct from neurons of interest . here \n we include two main features of the background into the model of @xmath34 : ( 1 ) the temporal component of each pixel has a constant large baseline and some slow trends ( see figure [ fig : example]d ) and ( 2 ) background is usually spatially smooth in a larger spatial range compared with neuron size ( figure [ fig : example ] ) , which means the background of all pixels within a neuron does not have large spatial gradients . \n this is because the fluctuations in the background reflects the out - of - focus fluorescence and they are significantly blurred . \n hence we model the background term as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 . \n @xmath38 explains the constant baselines and slow trends for all pixels ( figure [ fig : example]c ) and their temporal dynamics are much slower than calcium indicators . \n the second term @xmath39 models the fast fluctuation in the background and the spatial component @xmath40 has low spatial - frequency structure . \n the constraint of @xmath40 excludes cellular signals from the background term . \n in this section , we will describe our customized algorithm for fitting the model ( [ eq : y])([eq : arp])([eq : bg ] ) . \n we frequently use the pixel - wise formulation of model ( [ eq : y ] ) and ignore the noise term : @xmath41 our framework can be summarized into the following steps :    1 . \n initialize @xmath42 using the new initialization procedure . \n 2 .   approximate the background @xmath43 using model ( [ eq : bg ] ) . \n update @xmath42 from data @xmath44 using constrained alternating matrix factorization . \n 4 .   post - process the results automatically or manually : delete neurons , pick the missed neurons from the residuals , and merge neurons with high temporal correlations . \n repeat steps 2 , 3 , 4 until the results are biologically meaningful . \n our techniques differ from @xcite in the following aspects : ( 1 ) the initialization step for @xmath45 and @xmath46 here requires careful considerations of the background contaminations and our approach is totally new . \n ( 2 ) instead of updating the background term iteratively , we update the background independently in different iterations and the rank of the background model can be modified in each iteration . as a result , our algorithm has a better control of the residual levels in background .    in the followings , we mainly describe our novel initialization step and briefly summarize the procedure of fitting the background term . as for steps ( 3 - 5 ) and discussions for scalability issue , we put them in the supplementary materials ( section [ supp : iterative_manual ] and [ supp : speed ] ) .    , the initialized temporal activity of one neuron . \n d@xmath47 , raw data of the cropped small window ( green square in a and b ) . \n e@xmath47 , the estimated time - varying local backgrounds in the small cropped window . \n c@xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the re - ordered version of c@xmath47 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . \n c@xmath53 is the temporal differencing of c@xmath48 and the result has been thresholded with its @xmath54 standard deviation . \n similarly , d@xmath53 is differencing result of d@xmath48 . \n f , the initialized spatial and temporal components of the neuron.,width=529 ]      here we develop a robust procedure for initializing @xmath45 and @xmath46 without estimation of the background . \n this procedure utilizes the spatial smoothness feature in the background and removes it by spatial high - pass filtering of the raw data . \n we estimate the temporal component of one neuron @xmath15 from spatially filtered data and then use it to extract the corresponding spatial footprint @xmath14 from the raw data . in the step of estimating @xmath14 , we re - order all frames to make nearby frames share the similar local background levels and then take the temporal differencing to remove the background signals temporally . \n after that , we can use regression to get @xmath14 . repeating \n this process can initialize the required number of neurons . \n the whole procedure is schematically illustrated in figure [ fig : initialization ] and described in algorithm [ alg : init ] in the supplementary materials . \n the spatial smoothness assumption of the background leads to @xmath55 i.e. , within the spatial range of a cell body , the background is spatially invariant . \n based on this assumption , we use @xmath56 to filter the raw data @xmath6 , and @xmath56 is defined as @xmath57 where @xmath58 . \n @xmath59 is a gaussian kernel with width @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the the average size of the neurons . \n @xmath56 is a template matching filter to detect spatial structures with similar shapes and sizes . for flat structures in the small regions , like background , filtering them with @xmath56 \n get results close to 0 . \n thus in the filtered data @xmath62 , the background @xmath63 has been roughly removed and @xmath64 is mainly composed of cellular signals ( figure [ fig : initialization]b ) . \n more interestingly , the calcium concentrations of most neurons can be directly approximated by the temporal traces of some pixels in @xmath64 . \n ( figure [ fig : initialization]c@xmath47 , see section [ supp : filter ] in supplementary materials for derivation ) . \n we call these pixels seed pixels because we can use them to initialize neurons . \n we initialize neurons with a greedy algorithm . in each iteration , we find one seed pixel @xmath65 ( see supplementary materials section [ sec : seed ] for details of how to detect seed pixels ) and initialize its spatial footprint @xmath66 and temporal course @xmath67 \n . then we subtract @xmath68 from the raw video data , find the next seed pixel and repeat the initialization procedure until specified number of neurons have been initialized or no more seed pixels exist .    given a seed pixel @xmath65 , we can initialize the neuron s temporal component as @xmath69 ( figure [ fig : initialization]c@xmath47 ) . \n this approximation is usually good , and here we propose an efficient method to extract its spatial component @xmath14 from the raw data @xmath70 . \n we first crop the optical field with a square centered at @xmath65 and the square size is twice larger than the average neuron size @xmath61 ( figure [ fig : initialization]d@xmath47 ) . \n since cell bodies have localized structure , the spatial shape of the expected neuron is completely covered by this square . \n then we approximate the local background level in this cropped area @xmath71 using the median of the fluorescence intensities on the square boundary ( figure [ fig : initialization]e@xmath47 ) . by sorting all frames in an order of @xmath72 such that @xmath73 ( figure [ fig : initialization]c@xmath48d@xmath48e@xmath48 ) , nearby frames have the minimal differences ( @xmath74 ) in the background term . \n hence the differencing of the sorted video data is @xmath75 we already have @xmath76 , so we can initialize @xmath14 by regressing @xmath77 on @xmath78 ( figure [ fig : initialization]c@xmath53d@xmath53 ) . empirically we found that thresholding @xmath79 achieves better results . \n after we get @xmath80 ( figure [ fig : initialization]f ) , we can reestimate @xmath81 using a simple formula : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a vector replacing all nonzero pixels of @xmath84 with the mean of those nonzero pixels . by running this initialization procedure iteratively \n , we can extract almost all neurons .      after we get @xmath85 and @xmath86 \n , @xmath87 is mainly the background component and we will approximate it with a matrix described in eq . \n ( [ eq : bg ] ) . \n first we use a spline basis with low temporal dynamics to approximate the first term @xmath88 ( baseline + slow trend ) , then we factorize the residual @xmath89 with @xmath39 . by constraining @xmath40 with high spatial smoothness , we can avoid cellular signals being absorbed into the background . \n we use singular value decomposition ( svd ) together with low - pass filtering of the estimated spatial components to estimate @xmath90 and @xmath91 . \n ( see supplementary materials [ supp : bg ] for details ) . \n pca - ica ( @xcite ) is the most widely used automatic methods for analyzing microendoscopic data ( @xcite ) . \n it seeks spatially and temporally independent components as individual neurons . in this section \n we compared our cnmf - e with pca - ica method using simulated and experimental data . \n we simulated @xmath92 neurons activity in the optical field ( @xmath93 pixels ) for @xmath94 frames ( @xmath95 hz ) . to ensure that the background had similar features as real data \n , we utilized the background extracted from our experimental data as the background in our simulation . \n we also add i.i.d . \n gaussian noise to our model ( the simulated video data can be found here ) . \n after removing all false positives , pca - ica detected @xmath96 neurons and our cnmf - e method found @xmath97 neurons of the @xmath92 neurons . \n most neurons detected by pca - ica did not have localized structures and multiple neurons were combined together ( see supplementary figure [ fig : supp_ac ] ) . \n we superimposed the contours of all extracted neurons together on top of the locations of simulated neurons . \n pca - ica - based segmentation failed to identify a large proportion of the neurons in this dataset , whereas nearly every neuron was identified by the cnmf - e approach ( figure [ fig : sim]cd ) . \n we matched each simulated neuron with a neuron among all the extracted neurons by selecting the one most correlated with the simulated neuron temporally . \n for a pair of matched neuron , they should have both high temporal and spatial correlations in the perfect case , i.e. , the real cellular signal is extracted from the data with high fidelity . \n we displayed spatial and temporal correlations of all simulated neurons with their matched neurons detected by two approaches ( figure [ fig : sim]bd ) . a total number of @xmath97 simulated neurons were accurately recovered by our cnmf - e method ( figure [ fig : sim]d ) . while for pca - ica , a large proportion of the matched neurons have low spatial and temporal correlations ( figure [ fig : sim ] ) indicating failures in recovering real neurons signals . \n we also display @xmath98 tightly clustered neurons in the simulated data ( figure [ fig : sim]e ) to demonstrate that our cnmf - e approach can accurately detect and demix their activity ( figure [ fig : sim]g ) . \n the spatiotemporal similarity between the 4 neurons segmented with cnmf - e ( figure 3 g ) and ground truth ( figure 3e ) indicates a good performance in extracting the neural activity . \n in contrast , pca - ica based detection can only detect two neurons and the calcium traces have high level of noise . \n the reason is that pca - ica merges multiple neurons together spatially and distorts the calcium traces in the temporal domain . \n furthermore , the distorted calcium traces reduces the number of detected neurons . \n the data used here was collected from the prefrontal cortex ( pfc ) of a freely moving mouse . \n the frame rate is 15 hz . the raw image ( figure [ fig : data_example]a ) is blurry and it is difficult to visually detect any neurons . \n its local correlation image ( @xcite ) of the raw data is approximately uniform @xmath99 ( figure [ fig : data_example]c ) , which means neighboring pixels share strong background fluctuations . \n here we removed the background by spatially filtering the raw data with @xmath56 and then calculated local correlation image using eq . \n ( [ eq : pnr_corr ] ) in supplementary materials . \n figure [ fig : data_example]d clearly shows the locations of all neurons . \n appying our proposed cnmf - e method is able to detect @xmath100 neurons from the raw data . \n their contours are depicted on top the the correlation image and we can see that our method efficiently identifies neurons in the optical field ( figure [ fig : data_example]d ) . \n after subtracting the extracted background from the raw data , neural activity is visualized more effectively ( figure [ fig : data_example]b ) . \n the quality of this background correction on the raw data is important for extracting neural signals and demixing neurons . in the supplementary video ( ) \n , we showed the raw video , extracted background video , background corrected video and reconstructed cellular activity @xmath101 . from the video , we can see that cnmf - e reliably extracted the weak cellular signals from the rapidly fluctuating background . \n we choose three neighboring neurons within a small field to show the performance of our method . in figure \n [ fig : data_example]e , we showed their rois and the local correlation image . \n the mean fluorescence traces within each roi are too noisy to infer any calcium events . \n both pca - ica and cnmf - e isolated these three neurons and extracted the spiking signals , but the traces extracted with the pca - ica have higher levels of noise . \n further , note that traces extracted with pca - ica have large artifactual negative peaks . \n cnmf - e does not have this problem due to the nonnegative requirements . in the shaded region of figure [ fig : data_example]f , \n we demonstrate potential crosstalk between two neurons , that is avoided by cnmf - e but not pca - ica based segmentation ( watch video here . \n the temporal traces in the video are extracted from cnmf - e ) .     detected neurons and the correlation image calculated using our cnmf - e method ( see eq . \n ( [ eq : pnr_corr ] ) in supplementary materials ) . \n e , mean fluorescence traces from three rois . \n f , extracted spatial / temporal components of three neurons using pca - ica method . \n g , results using our cnmf - e method . \n , width=529 ] \n in this paper , we proposed an efficient method for extracting cellular signals from microendoscopic data ; such methods are in very high demand in the neuroscience community . \n the analysis of this video data is the first stage of processing in many experiments , so the quality of source extraction in this step highly influences the scientific conclusions drawn in downstream analysis . as shown in figure [ fig : sim ] and [ fig : data_example ] , \n our method shows credible performances in recovering the real neuronal signals and outperforms the previous standard pca - ica method . \n thus the methods introduced here ( which we plan to release as open source software ) will be a powerful and important tool for the neuroscience community . \n funding for this research was provided by nih 2r01mh064537 ( p.z . \n , r.k . ) , nih r90da023426 ( p.z . ) , national institute of child health nichd and human development hd079124 ( g.s . ) , nichd grant t32 hd040127 ( s.r . ) , simons research foundation ( g.s . ) , simons foundation global brain research awards 325171 , 365002 , aro muri w911nf-12 -

to - noise ratio ( pnr ) because it encodes the calcium concentration @xmath102 of one neuron and usually @xmath102 has large calcium transients ; second , seed pixel has high temporal correlations with its neighboring pixels because they are likely to share the same @xmath102 . \n we computed two metrics for each of these two features : @xmath115 where @xmath116 ( we use @xmath117 ) determines the range of neighbors and @xmath118 is the total number of neighboring pixels . \n @xmath119 calculates the temporal correlation between two time series @xmath120 and @xmath121 . \n the function @xmath122 is a pre - processing of @xmath64 before computing local correlation . in our implementation , we threshold the differencing of @xmath113 by @xmath123 ( e.g. , @xmath124 . \n this is equivalent to a rough detection of calcium transients . it is better than using @xmath64 directly because it reduces the influence of the background residual , noise and negative spikes from nearby neurons . to avoid unnecessary searches of the seed pixels , we usually set thresholds for both @xmath125 ( e.g. , 5 ) and @xmath126 ( e.g. , 0.5 ) . in each iteration of the initialization \n , we find the pixel with the maximum value of @xmath127 and set it as a seed pixel . here \n we use point - wise product of @xmath125 and @xmath126 to emphasize the characteristics of seed pixels . \n if we successfully initialize one neuron from this seed pixel , the spatiotemporal activity of this initialized neuron @xmath128 will be peeled off from the residual data ( it is @xmath70 at the beginning of the initialization ) . \n we also have to locally update @xmath125 and @xmath126 in the initialized area . \n each neuron can only be visited once for initialization . \n we will stop the initialization procedure until the specified number @xmath19 reaches or there are no more seed pixels . \n define @xmath130 as nonzero pixels of @xmath84 and @xmath131 then @xmath132 again , the spatial smoothness of the background term @xmath133 induces @xmath134 . when the overlaps between neurons are not severe , @xmath135 , hence , we have @xmath136      the trends of all pixels are independent and we approximate all trends with b - spline basis @xmath137 , i.e. , @xmath138 , where the row vectors of @xmath137 are cubic b - spline basis given a sequences of knots . by increasing the intervals between knots , \n we lower the number of basis and constrain the dynamics of @xmath139 to be slow . \n we usually choose evenly distributed knots over the whole time period with an interval of @xmath140 seconds . \n this is much larger than dynamics of the calcium indicators ( @xmath141 seconds ) . \n @xmath142 contains coefficients of each spline basis . \n it is estimated with regression @xmath143\\cdot[xx^t]^{-1}$ ] .    after we remove the @xmath38 , we move on to approximate the the fast fluctuations @xmath144 with low rank-@xmath118 matrix @xmath39 . \n the truncated svd of @xmath145 has the globally minimum frobenious norm of the difference between @xmath145 and @xmath39 . \n here we choose row vectors of @xmath91 be the top @xmath118 right singular vectors of @xmath145 and then @xmath146 . \n however , the computed @xmath40 is not guaranteed to have low spatial frequency structure . \n we post - process @xmath40 to enforce this constraint . here \n we low - pass filter it with a median filter to get @xmath90 . \n the size of the median filter is chosen larger than a neuron size . \n then the background is estimated with @xmath147      empirically after the initialization of @xmath42 and approximating @xmath43 with model ( [ eq : bg ] ) , the results are very close to the optimal solutions . \n but we can still make the parameter estimations better by iteratively updating model parameters . \n there are several things we can do : ( 1 ) deconvolve the temporal components in @xmath46 to get denoised calcium traces , ( 2 ) delete false positive neurons , ( 3 ) pick neurons from the residual @xmath148 , and ( 4 ) merge neurons that were inappropriately split into several components . \n all these operations can lead to better extraction of cellular signals . \n each time when we update @xmath43 , we run the same procedure as section [ supp : bg ] again \n . we can adaptively change the b - spline basis and rank of @xmath39 to get better approximation . \n for example , when we see some trend in cellular signals , we can use spline basis with more knots to explain this trend in the background . \n sometimes the background corrected data is still blurry because we do not remove the background cleanly . in this case , we can increase the rank to @xmath39 term in background to explain it .    to update @xmath85 and @xmath86 \n , we keep the background @xmath43 unchanged , i.e. , we fit the model @xmath149 . \n this can be done using the same approaches described in @xcite and we need to make changes by removing the background term ( see section [ sec : updateac ] ) \n .    our method can also allow users verify the extracted cells visually and delete those low - quality neurons . \n the spatiotemporal activity of these deleted neurons will be absorbed by the background @xmath43 or other neurons . \n the signal qualities of nearby neurons might be improved . to add a neuron from the residual @xmath148 , we first select one pixel @xmath65 ( usually the one with the maximum residual ) and then run a rank-1 nmf in a small window centered at @xmath65 to get its spatial and temporal components . we can also manually or automatically select @xmath65 . \n although these steps are simple , they showed great helps in speeding up the model fitting procedure . as a comparison , \n pca - ica method has no manual intervention steps . \n removing false positive neurons could not improve signal extraction of other neurons . \n after subtracting the background from the raw data , we can optimize @xmath45 and @xmath46 by fitting the model @xmath150 this is the same cnmf problem as proposed by @xcite . \n the trivial difference is that eq . \n ( [ eq : new_cnmf ] ) has no background term . \n we can use the same optimization procedure to estimate @xmath29 . here \n we rewrite their approaches for this optimization approach . \n briefly they iteratively update @xmath45 and @xmath46 by solving two optimization problems . \n ( 1 ) given the estimates of @xmath151 in previously iterations , @xmath152 can be updated by solving the following convex problem @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the standard deviation of the gaussian noise for each pixel @xmath111 . ( 2 ) once we update @xmath155 , we update @xmath156 column by column . to update the @xmath114th column \n , we first form the quantity @xmath157[\\mathbf{c}_1^{(k)},\\cdots , \\mathbf{c}_{j-1}^{(k ) } , \\mathbf{c}_{j+1}^{(k-1)}\\cdots , \\mathbf{c}_k^{(k-1)}]^t\\big),\\ ] ] and then apply any deconvolution method of choice to @xmath158 to obtain @xmath159 . \n we usually use the noise - constrained deconvolution method used in @xcite .    removing the spatial sparsity constraint and the temporal dynamics can \n significantly reduces the computation time and the results are close to the optimal solution . in this case , \n ( [ eq : new_cnmf ] ) is a plain nmf problem with some locality constrains . \n @xcite adapted the hierarchical alternating least squares ( hals ) method ( @xcite ) algorithm to solve it with fast speed . \n in our implementations , we frequently use the hals algorithm to get convergent results before running the full cnmf approaches . \n our method is very fast in analyzing data . in the example of the simulated data ( @xmath93 pixels , 3000 frames ) , our naive matlab implementation took @xmath160 minutes to initialize @xmath161 neurons out of @xmath92 on a single desktop . fitting the background model given \n @xmath42 requires @xmath162 seconds . \n the manual interventions of adding / deleting neurons only need few clicks and they can be processed in real time . \n the results of our initialization step are very close the final solutions , so we only need @xmath163 cnmf iterations to update model parameters . \n the performances of those algorithms used for solving cnmf have been reported in @xcite and @xcite . \n our implementations can be easily optimized to be faster . in the initialization step , \n spatial filtering and calculation of the local correlation images are the only computation - intensive parts in the processing of huge data sets . \n these computations themselves are very classical matrix operations and utilizing gpu can significantly make it faster . since the initialization of each neuron is only dependent on a very small window , the whole initialization step can be easily processed in parallel by segmenting the optical field into multiple small patches . \n we can also use distributed computing to process the data patch by patch . \n fitting the background model requires two steps : ( 1 ) the first step is approximating the baseline and slow trends . \n since all pixels are independent , we can easily run it in parallel without effort ; ( 2 ) the second step is basically svd and there are plenties of existing algorithms or packages to deal with this problem for extremely large datasets . in summary , all the algorithm proposed in this paper has no scalability issues and can be easily scaled for processing any large - scale datasets .", "human_aspect": "{\n  \"background\": \"in vivo calcium imaging through microscopes has enabled deep brain imaging of previously inaccessible neuronal populations within the brains of freely moving subjects. however, microendoscopic data suffer from high levels of background fluorescence as well as an increased potential for overlapping neuronal signals. previous methods fail in identifying neurons and demixing their temporal activity because the cellular signals are often submerged in the large fluctuating background.\",\n  \"method\": \"we model the background with two realistic components: (1) one models the constant baseline and slow trends of each pixel, and (2) the other models the fast fluctuations from out-of-focus signals and is therefore constrained to have low spatial-frequency structure. this decomposition avoids cellular signals being absorbed into the background term. after subtracting the background approximated with this model, we use constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (cnmf, @xcite) to better demix neural signals and get their denoised and deconvolved temporal activity.\",\n  \"result\": \"we validate our method on simulated and experimental data, where it shows fast, reliable, and high quality signal extraction under a wide variety of imaging parameters.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"\"\n}", "gpt35_aspect": "{\n  \"background\": \"Monitoring the activity of large-scale neuronal ensembles during complex behavioral states is essential in neuroscience research.

@xmath152 .    for any @xmath133 in the interval @xmath153 \n there exists a point @xmath154 inside the plasma at which @xmath155 and consequently @xmath156 . at this point \n the local plasma frequency is in resonance with the mode frequency and the differential equation  ( [ eqn : radialx ] ) has a singular point . in these cases \n the solutions of  ( [ eqn : radialx ] ) can be singular and are associated with a continuous spectrum and , possibly , damped quasi - modes , see e.g.  @xcite . \n the appropriate approach for uncovering the quasi - modes is a laplace transform of eqs . \n ( [ eqn : perturbed ] ) . here \n we restrict ourselves to regular normal mode solutions with @xmath148 . \n having obtained these general properties we now explicitly determine the eigenfrequencies . \n let us first consider the limit @xmath55 . performing a series expansion of eq . \n ( [ eqn : eigenvalues ] ) for @xmath157 ( details can be found in appendix  [ sec : appendixb ] ) we find @xmath158 for coulomb interaction ( @xmath159 ) we get @xmath160 . \n this is the well known result for surface oscillations of a homogeneous plasma sphere  @xcite . \n furthermore it is easily verified that @xmath161 is a solution of eq . \n ( [ eqn : eigenvalues ] ) for any @xmath3 . \n this mode describes the center of mass oscillation ( dipole or sloshing mode ) and is independent of the particle number and the screening parameter  @xcite . \n another solution in the coulomb limit is given by the coulomb plasma frequency @xmath162 . \n this can easily be seen from eq . \n ( [ eqn : poisson_diel ] ) with @xmath38 . since the dielectric function inside the plasma vanishes for @xmath163 , eq . \n ( [ eqn : poisson_diel ] ) is satisfied for any @xmath164 that satisfies the boundary conditions  ( [ eqn : boundarycond ] ) . \n this implies a high degeneracy since these requirements can be met by an infinite number of modes with arbitrary @xmath165 .    for yukawa interaction with a finite @xmath3 \n this degeneracy is lifted and a series expansion yields ( see appendix  [ sec : appendixb ] ) @xmath166 where @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 . from this series of expansion coefficients \n we see that the frequency approaches @xmath170 as @xmath130 increases . \n for @xmath171 the hypergeometric series does not converge in general at @xmath142 . \n however , a closer inspection of the series representation  ( [ eqn:2f1series ] ) reveals that a well behaved solution can be obtained if @xmath172 or @xmath173 is a negative integer @xmath174 . in these cases \n the series is simply a polynomial of order @xmath175 , where @xmath176 . \n since @xmath177 we require @xmath178 . solving this equation for @xmath133 yields @xmath179 keeping in mind that at this point @xmath180 we find @xmath181,\\nonumber\\\\ \\zeta_{n \\ell}&= ( 2n-1)(n+\\ell)-4,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath182 for @xmath183 . \n even though this choice guarantees a well behaved solution , it can be shown that eqs . \n ( [ eqn : omegamaxnl],[eqn : xicrit ] ) do not solve the eigenvalue equation  ( [ eqn : eigenvalues ] ) . \n nevertheless , a numerical evaluation shows that solutions do exist for @xmath184 which closely approach @xmath185 as @xmath186 . \n this issue will be dealt with in more detail in sec . \n [ ssec : normalmodes2 ] . \n let us now discuss the limit @xmath187 . \n using @xmath148 one can show that @xmath188 . \n as before , the convergence problem at this point can be circumvented by choosing the parameters of the hypergeometric function such that its series terminates at a finite order . \n requiring @xmath189 ( @xmath190 ) and solving the equation for @xmath191 yields the solution for the eigenfrequencies in the limit @xmath4 , @xmath192 the reason we chose the same index @xmath5 as in the previous case will become clear shortly . \n it is shown in appendix  [ sec : appendixb ] that  ( [ eqn : freqlimit ] ) actually solves eq . \n ( [ eqn : eigenvalues ] ) . \n further , the lowest order correction for finite @xmath3 is found as @xmath193 where the coefficients are given by @xmath194.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     for various modes @xmath195 . also shown ( by the arrows ) \n are the limits for @xmath67 and @xmath4 . \n the crosses denote the parameters at which new modes appear to the right of @xmath196.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]      for arbitrary values of @xmath3 we solved eq . \n ( [ eqn : eigenvalues ] ) numerically . \n the results are shown in fig . \n [ fig : eigenfrequencies ] . in the weak screening limit , \n @xmath55 , the known coulomb limit is recovered , where @xmath197 ( surface modes ) or @xmath198 ( bulk modes )  @xcite . except for the center of mass mode \n all mode frequencies increase with @xmath3 and saturate in the limit @xmath4 . \n we find numerically that the eigenmodes with mode number @xmath199 ( @xmath182 for @xmath183 ) at @xmath200 approach @xmath185 as @xmath3 is decreased and cease to exist for @xmath201 . \n thus , the chosen indices are the same and the modes evolve continuously from @xmath202 to @xmath200 . \n let us briefly summarize the findings of this section . \n the main result is that screening lifts the degeneracy of the bulk modes of the coulomb system and the appearance of a new mode number @xmath5 . for a given value of @xmath3 the number of allowed modes \n is restricted . modes with @xmath203 ( @xmath204 ) and @xmath183 with @xmath205 exist for all @xmath206 whereas our numerical solution of eq . \n ( [ eqn : eigenvalues ] ) indicates that all other modes exist only for @xmath184 . \n the @xmath207 mode is a special case with @xmath208 . \n having found the eigenfrequencies we can now come back to the discussion of the shape of the normal modes .        the eigenmodes in the coulomb limit are well known , see e.g.  @xcite . \n the surface modes with @xmath209 are given by @xmath210 and @xmath211 , cf . \n ( [ eqn : potout],[eqn : potin ] ) , while the bulk modes oscillate at the plasma frequency @xmath149 . \n the potential eigenfunctions in the latter case are undefined inside the plasma , which can easily be seen from eq . \n ( [ eqn : poisson_diel ] ) . since the dielectric function in the coulomb limit is constant for @xmath74 , eq . \n ( [ eqn : poisson_diel ] ) is satisfied for any @xmath164 if @xmath163 . \n the potential perturbation is only restricted by the boundary conditions  ( [ eqn : boundarycond ] ) . \n it follows from eqs . \n ( [ eqn : boundarycond ] ) and @xmath212 that @xmath213  @xcite . \n this further implies that @xmath214 , see eq . \n ( [ eqn : bound1 ] ) .    in the following \n we will discuss the eigenmodes for yukawa interaction and point out the similarities and differences when compared with the coulomb limit . \n for @xmath215 the radial eigenfunctions  ( [ eqn : potin ] ) inside the plasma explicitly depend on @xmath133 , which was shown to have several solutions for a given @xmath130 . \n thus , in addition to the angular mode numbers @xmath12 and @xmath130 , there is a radial mode number @xmath5 which determines the structure of the radial eigenfunction . \n the radial function is given by eq . \n ( [ eqn : potin ] ) and the corresponding eigenfrequency is determined by eq . \n ( [ eqn : eigenvalues ] ) . \n let us begin with the limit @xmath4 . \n it was already shown in sec . \n [ ssec : eigenfrequencies ] that in this case the hypergeometric function reduces to a polynomial of order @xmath5 in @xmath216 . from eqs . \n ( [ eqn : potin],[eqn : freqlimit ] ) we thus get the radial eigenfunctions @xmath217 where the @xmath218 are jacobi polynomials . \n the @xmath203 surface modes are particularly simple . here , the sum in eq . \n ( [ eqn : modelimit ] ) is just a constant and the eigenmodes inside the plasma are the same as in the coulomb limit . \n there are no radial nodes . for finite @xmath3 \n we find that the solutions differ only slightly from the results at @xmath67 or @xmath219 . \n these modes are the natural generalization of the surface modes to yukawa interaction and there are no qualitative changes compared to a coulomb system . in particular , the dipole modes with @xmath220 \n describe the three center of mass oscillations and have eigenfunctions @xmath221 , independent of @xmath3 . \n the origin of the modes with @xmath222 can be traced back to the bulk modes of the coulomb system , see fig . \n [ fig : eigenfrequencies ] . while for @xmath67 the eigenmodes \n are not entirely specified , for @xmath215 their form is determined by eq . \n ( [ eqn : potin ] ) , together with  ( [ eqn : eigenvalues ] ) for the eigenfrequency . in the limit @xmath4 the potential perturbations \n are given by eq . \n ( [ eqn : modelimit ] ) , see fig . \n [ fig : infmodes ] . \n @xmath5 is the number of radial nodes . with increasing @xmath130 the nodes and extrema \n are shifted towards the cluster boundary .    the behavior for finite @xmath3 is shown in fig . \n [ fig : n1n2modes ] . the @xmath183 modes with \n @xmath205 extend up to @xmath67 , while all other modes with @xmath199 exist only for @xmath184 .     for various modes as indicated in the figure.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    let us discuss the former case first . \n as we move from the @xmath200 limit towards @xmath67 , the single node approaches @xmath150 , see fig . \n [ fig : n1n2modes]a , b . \n the radial eigenfunctions at @xmath223 read @xmath224 where @xmath205 and @xmath225 must be evaluated at @xmath198 . \n compare also with the series expansion performed in appendix  [ sec : appendixb ] . \n this form is in accordance with @xmath214 for @xmath67 ( the coefficients @xmath226 were chosen to ensure this ) . \n thus , these modes also exist in a coulomb system , where they are among the bulk modes with @xmath163 . \n the main difference between coulomb and yukawa interaction at this point is that in the former case the mode form is not specified by eq . \n ( [ eqn : poisson_diel ] ) . for @xmath215 \n this equation constitutes an additional restriction on the mode form and selects the eligible modes for @xmath223 from the large number of modes at @xmath67 .    in the case of all other modes with @xmath199 \n the outermost node comes arbitrarily close to @xmath150 as @xmath3 decreases , but disappears at @xmath202 , see fig . \n [ fig : n1n2modes]c , d . \n this goes along with a very strong increase of @xmath227 at the boundary , which makes the numerical solution of eq . \n ( [ eqn : eigenvalues ] ) increasingly difficult . if @xmath228 were a proper solution , the boundary conditions  ( [ eqn : boundarycond ] ) and eq . \n ( [ eqn : radialout ] ) would require @xmath229 , and hence @xmath214 , just like for @xmath67 and @xmath163 . however , the potential inside the plasma is not undefined but determined by the solutions of eq . \n ( [ eqn : poisson_diel ] ) . \n analogously to the case @xmath200 , eq . \n ( [ eqn : potin ] ) reduces to a polynomial at @xmath230 but can not satisfy the boundary conditions since @xmath231 . \n our numerical solutions of eq . \n ( [ eqn : eigenvalues ] ) indicate that these modes exist only for @xmath184 .     for various @xmath3 and mode numbers @xmath195.,scaledwidth=47.0% ] \n the lowest monopole mode has the index @xmath232 and is worth a more detailed discussion . \n for @xmath4 the fluid velocity satisfies @xmath233 since @xmath234 is quadratic in @xmath92 , see eq . \n ( [ eqn : vel1 ] ) . \n this corresponds to a uniform breathing oscillation of the plasma . in the coulomb limit \n this mode is among the bulk modes . \n it was shown in ref . \n @xcite that a system of @xmath23 harmonically confined particles with yukawa interaction does not support a universal uniform breathing mode . \n we find a similar behavior in our fluid approach since the uniformity condition is only fulfilled for @xmath4 . \n for finite @xmath3 the uniformity condition is not satisfied , see fig . \n [ fig : breathingmode ] . \n further , it is surprising that it is not recovered as @xmath235 . \n however , this is not contradictory since this solution is just one among many in the coulomb limit . here , the breathing mode is given by @xmath236 , which also satisfies the boundary condition @xmath214  @xcite . \n the aforementioned breathing mode has been studied by sheridan  @xcite under the assumption of a homogeneous density and a uniform displacement . \n we find that his analytical result for @xmath237 agrees with our numerical results to within @xmath238 for any @xmath3 . \n note , however , that the equation @xmath3 is determined from in  @xcite is different from eq . \n ( [ eqn : radius ] ) , since @xmath3 used in  @xcite involves the radius for a _ homogeneous _ sphere . \n this mode was found to be the dominant excitation during spherical crystal formation after a rapid temperature quench  @xcite . \n summarizing our results , we have investigated the ground state and the normal modes of a harmonically confined yukawa plasma in a fluid approach . \n the results of  @xcite were extended to a time - dependent theory and simple formulas for the plasma radius , total energy and density moments were obtained . \n the density moments could be used to infer the dimensionless plasma parameter @xmath0 , the ratio of the plasma radius to the screening length , from experimental data . for typical dusty plasma experiments with @xmath239 and @xmath240 \n we expect @xmath241  @xcite . \n further , the fluid equations were linearized and solved for the normal modes . \n compared with previous results for coulomb interaction , we found a new class of modes with a radial mode number @xmath5 that determines the number of radial nodes in the potential eigenfunctions . \n the eigenfrequencies were found to depend only on @xmath3 . \n the degeneracy of the bulk modes in the coulomb limit was shown to be lifted for yukawa interaction and series expansions for the eigenfrequencies were derived for limiting cases . for experimentally relevant parameters \n they must be determined numerically , though . \n the fluid theory should be applicable for large clusters with @xmath242 . in \n @xcite it was shown that the agreement between the continuum theory and the exact @xmath23-particle ground state was good at low screening , but deviations increased for larger @xmath54 . applying the local density approximation , \n the authors were able reduce the deviations for strong screening  @xcite . \n the same behavior was observed in  @xcite , where the frequency of the monopole mode excited in a langevin dynamics simulation was compared with the theory of  @xcite . \n thus , similar behavior is expected for the results presented here . \n additionally , one has to bear in mind that the fluid equations correspond to a mean - field description and neglect correlation effects . \n they are thus not able to describe crystallization and shell structure formation . \n the same applies to the local density approximation used in  @xcite . \n this question was recently analyzed in  @xcite . only a comparison with first principle simulation data \n will show the true applicability limits of the fluid approach . \n this analysis is subject of ongoing work

The 3pcf is a measure of the probability of finding a galaxy at a given location, given the locations of two other galaxies. The algorithm we present is based on a decomposition of the 3pcf into its multipole moments, which was first introduced by Szapudi (2004) and later developed by Slepian & Eisenstein (2015). This decomposition allows us to isolate the linear and non-linear bias of galaxies, as well as a possible relative velocity bias.\n\nOur algorithm is significantly faster than previous algorithms, scaling as the number of galaxies in the survey times the number within a given opening angle, rather than the number of possible triangles. This is achieved by writing the opening angle dependence of the triangles about a given vertex in terms of Legendre polynomials, which can be factored into a product of spherical harmonics each depending on only one unit vector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm using a mock galaxy catalog and show that it produces accurate measurements of the 3pcf.\n\nThe ability to measure the 3pcf of galaxies accurately and efficiently is crucial for understanding the properties of the universe on large scales, and our algorithm represents a significant step forward in this area. Our method can be used to probe the cosmological parameters, test models of galaxy formation and evolution, and provide insights into the nature of dark matter and dark energy.

gaussianity ( desjacques & seljak 2010 ) ; while the constraints on this are currently dominated by cmb experiments such as planck , it is expected that the increasing quality and number of galaxy redshift surveys will provide interesting independent information .    since the first measurement by peebles & groth ( 1977 ) , numerous studies have presented 3pcf measurements , summarized in kayo et al . \n ( 2004 ) , mcbride et al . \n ( 2011a , b ) , guo et al . \n ( 2014 ) and references therein . in this work \n , we present a new algorithm for measuring the 3pcf of galaxies through its multipole moments . \n this decomposition of the 3pcf was first advanced in szapudi ( 2004 ) and to a limited extent ( measurement of the monopole moment ) used in pan & szapudi ( 2005 ) on two - degree - field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) data . \n slepian & eisenstein ( 2015 ) ( hereafter se15 ) found this decomposition to be particularly useful for distinguishing linear and non - linear bias as well as isolating a possible relative velocity bias . \n current algorithms , such as that used for the mcbride et al . \n ( 2011 ) measurement ( presented in moore et al . 2001 , gray et al . \n 2004 , nichol et al . \n 2006 , and gardner et al . \n 2007 ) fundamentally scale as the number of possible triangles in a survey . if one wishes to measure the 3pcf out to some scale @xmath2 , there are @xmath3 relevant triangles , where @xmath4 is the number of objects in the survey , @xmath5 is the survey number density and @xmath6 . \n the algorithm presented in the series of references above , whose most recent incarnation is developed in march ( 2013 ) , uses multiple mrkd - trees . \n here `` mr '' means the kd - tree caches additional information , in this case the number of galaxies within each node of the tree as well as the bounding box of the node . \n this algorithm is faster than simply counting all triangles . \n it is particularly effective if the galaxies are close to each other , so that there are many triangles whose side lengths fall within a given combination of radial bins . \n however , typical galaxy surveys are sparse , particularly those mapping the largest volumes . \n for example , the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) has an average separation of 13 @xmath7 , too large to permit many galaxies to be in the same bin . \n this means the algorithm will not be as fast for such large - scale measurements . \n the use case tested in march ( 2013 ) is triangles with three sides of @xmath8 mpc each , much smaller than the scales that are well - described by linear perturbation theory and hence most useful for cosmology . \n furthermore , even with the speed - ups coming from the multi - tree structure of the algorithm , it is still fundamentally scaling as the number of galaxies in the survey times the square of the number within @xmath2 ( march 2013 , figure 21 ) .    in this paper , we present an algorithm that does better : it scales as the number of galaxies in the survey times the number within @xmath2 , and so by construction is significantly faster than any previous algorithm that is exact in angle . in brief \n , we write the opening angle dependence of the triangles about a given vertex in terms of legendre polynomials of @xmath9 , where these are two unit vectors describing two triangle sides . \n the dot product seems to require explicitly considering all pairs of galaxies about a given vertex ( i.e. third galaxy ) , but using the spherical harmonic addition theorem , this representation can be factored into a product of spherical harmonics each depending on only one unit vector . therefore from the spherical harmonic expansion of the radially binned density field \n one can obtain the multipole moments without ever needing to consider pairs about a given vertex . \n this is the central insight of this paper .    in section [ sec : \n algorithm ] , we present the algorithm in more detail , and show in section [ sec : proj3pcf ] how this framework goes through to the projected 3pcf . \n section [ sec : edgecorrxn ] discusses edge correction , while section [ sec : implementation ] describes our implementation . \n section [ sec : covariance ] computes the covariance of this multipole decomposition in the gaussian random field limit , and section [ sec : mock_results ] presents the results of using the algorithm on the lasdamas sdss - ii data release 7 ( sdss - dr7 ) luminous red galaxy mock catalogs . \n we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] . \n in this paper , we parametrize triangle configurations by two side lengths , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and the angle between them with cosine @xmath12 \n . we will decompose the 3pcf as a function of these three variables into a sum over legendre polynomials for the angular dependence times radial coefficients encoding the side length dependence , as @xmath13 szapudi ( 2004 ) first advanced this decomposition , and he puts a factor of @xmath14 in front of his analogous expansion coefficients ; we absorb this into @xmath15 . \n there are three major advantages to this decomposition . \n first , the shape of the 3pcf for fixed side lengths as a function of angle is smooth and slowly varying ( see e.g. bernardeau 2002 , figure 11 ) , without much fine structure . \n thus we expect that only a few multipoles will be required to capture the angle dependence . \n second , this decomposition provides a natural way to visualize the 3pcf for all triangle configurations ; one can make several panels for different @xmath16 , each with all @xmath10 and @xmath11 and amplitudes indicated by a colorbar , as in se15 . \n in contrast to many previous works , this allows immediate appraisal of the information in all triangles and not just a particular set of configurations ( e.g. isosceles , two - to - one , etc . )    third , as we will see , the multipole moments of the 3pcf can be obtained with much greater speed than other decompositions of the 3pcf . however , in contrast to other fast methods , such as tree methods that fix a critical angular scale below which they are approximate ( e.g. zhang & pen 2005 ) or fourier methods that choose a grid with some minimum spacing , we do not sacrifice accuracy to obtain this speed . \n our method is exact in angle . \n we will bin in side length , but even were speed of no concern this would be necessary to keep the covariance matrix to a reasonable size . \n the 3pcf describes the number of triangles of a given configuration whose vertices are the galaxies in a survey . while nine coordinates are required to completely describe any individual triangle connecting three galaxies , the 3pcf averages over both translations and rotations of the triangle configuration . \n the presumed losslessness of this averaging corresponds to the two usual cosmological assumptions of isotropy ( rotation - invariance about a given point ) and homogeneity ( translation - invariance ) . \n this ultimately reduces the 3pcf to a function of only three variables ; as indicated already , we will use two triangle sides and the angle between them . \n we will now show explicitly how to go from nine coordinates to three . \n we begin with averaging over rotations . \n we will show explicitly that legendre polynomials are an angular basis for the 3pcf after this averaging . \n to do so , we first step back and write an estimate ( denoted by a hat ) of the 3pcf for a triangle with sides @xmath17 extending from a vertex whose absolute position within the survey is @xmath18 . \n we have @xmath19    we now wish to average over all rotations of the triangle about @xmath18 . \n writing a rotation as @xmath20 ( simply a matrix involving the three euler angles ) , we have @xmath21 where subscript `` iso '' abbreviates `` isotropy . '' \n noting that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a wigner matrix ( e.g. arfken , weber & harris 2013 ( hereafter awh13 ) , equation ( 16.52 ) ) , we find @xmath24 the integral over wigner matrices is simply evaluated by orthogonality ( e.g. brink & satchler 1993 , appendix v ) as @xmath25 , @xmath26 the kronecker delta . using the spherical harmonic addition theorem ( awh13 , equation ( 16.57 ) ) @xmath27 and defining @xmath28 we find @xmath29 in what follows we drop the subscript `` iso '' as we will always be considering the isotropic 3pcf . \n we now move to averaging over translations . \n recalling that @xmath18 is the vertex of the triangle from which the two sides given by @xmath17 extend , the densities on a particular triangle of points will be @xmath30 . averaging over translations means allowing every point in the survey to serve as the vertex @xmath18 , so we must integrate over @xmath31 . \n we thus find that the @xmath32 radial coefficient of the 3pcf is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the survey volume . \n our algorithm will bin radially ( denoted with a bar ) , so we seek @xmath35 with @xmath36 a binning function demanding that we are in the bin given by its second argument . binning averages the radial coefficient over some interval in each side length , and in that sense is not lossless . \n it is also necessary for the speed advantage of our algorithm , as will become clear shortly . \n we will not compute using equation ( [ eqn : binned_zeta ] ) . \n rather , we will bin radially around each possible origin @xmath18 _ before _ averaging over rotations and translations , so it will be useful also to define the binned estimator before translation - averaging as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the radially binned density field about an origin @xmath39 . \n hence in practice we never compute @xmath40 using equation ( [ eqn : binned_zeta ] ) , but rather measure @xmath41 via equation ( [ eqn : binned_zetahat_l ] ) and then compute @xmath42 as the radially binned multipole coefficients of the 3pcf .      a direct way to measure @xmath43 would be to sit on every possible origin and compute the angle between pairs of vectors pointing to all possible sets of two galaxies out to the radius @xmath2 to which one wishes to measure the 3pcf . \n this scales as @xmath3 . \n as discussed in the introduction , this scaling applies to other algorithms as well ( e.g. the gardner ( 2007 ) and march ( 2013 ) kd - tree approach ) , fundamentally because the number of possible triangles within @xmath2 with one vertex fixed scales as @xmath44 . \n however , as is the case for angular power spectra , we can exploit a property of multipole decompositions to enormously accelerate the measurement . \n we can use the spherical harmonic addition theorem ( [ eqn : sph_addition_theorem ] ) to decompose the legendre polynomial into factors that depend only on one angular variable each . inserting this into equation ( [ eqn : binned_zetahat_l ] ) , we find @xmath45 this equation immediately shows how to reduce the quadratic scaling in the number density to a linear scaling . \n the two angular integrals have now been separated , and each simply asks for a particular expansion coefficient of the density field ( as a function of angle alone ) in spherical harmonics , in a fixed radial bin . \n in other words , if we compute for each radial bin @xmath46 @xmath47 we can construct all combinations dictated by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , without ever needing to do an @xmath48 operation . \n explicitly , inserting equation ( [ eqn : almsdef ] ) into equation ( [ eqn : zetal_int ] ) , we find @xmath49 this is why radial binning is essential for the speed - up of our algorithm ; we can precompute the @xmath50s in each radial bin . for @xmath51 \n , we then only need to construct @xmath52 combinations of these coefficients . a schematic about a single possible origin \n is shown in figure [ fig : kernel ] .    for a 3pcf measurement , one might use a bin width @xmath53 mpc , and so if one measures out to @xmath54 there will be only @xmath55 distinct bin combinations . \n meanwhile , computing the @xmath50s themselves takes only as long as performing the integral ( [ eqn : almsdef ] ) , which should scale as @xmath56 . \n we still must integrate over all possible choices of origin as dictated by equation ( [ eqn : translation_avg ] ) . because the galaxies are discrete , this will reduce to a sum with @xmath4 terms . \n thus our algorithm will scale as @xmath57 : linear in both the total number of galaxies _ and _ the number within a sphere of radius @xmath2 , and a factor of order @xmath58 faster than the naive counting approach . \n our algorithm thus provides a route to the 3pcf that on large scales is no more computationally intensive than calculating the multipole moments ( standardly calculated are monopole and quadrupole ) of the 2-point correlation function ( 2pcf ) .    ) . \n the @xmath59 can be combined to yield the multipole moments around this galaxy ( sum over @xmath60 , equation ( [ eqn : zetal_ito_alms ] ) ) and then translation - averaged to yield @xmath15 for the survey . ]    finally , to obtain the spherical harmonic coefficients of the galaxy density as in equation ( [ eqn : almsdef ] ) , one might think a spherical harmonic transform is required . \n this scales as @xmath61 , @xmath62 the number of spatial grid cells on the surface of a sphere . \n a large number of grid cells is necessary for accuracy even if there are very few galaxies , much as a small @xmath63 is needed when taking a numerical fourier transform to avoid ringing . \n however , because only low - order multipoles are needed here ( @xmath64 ) , we can avoid this transform and instead directly evaluate the @xmath65s , which are simply spherical harmonics evaluated at angles given by a galaxy s location with respect to a given choice of origin . \n the required @xmath66s can be easily computed using the cartesian expressions for the spherical harmonics ( e.g. awh13 , equation ( 15.139 ) and table 15.4 ) . indeed , about a given origin , the cartesian components @xmath67 and @xmath68 and their powers for each galaxy can be pre - calculated just once and subsequently combined to form all of the required multipoles . \n redshift - space distortions ( rsd ) are differences between the true position of a galaxy along the line of sight and its position as inferred from assuming its redshift is purely cosmological . \n they arise from peculiar velocities , ultimately generated by the growth of large - scale structure ( hamilton 1998 , for a review ) . \n the projected 3pcf is insensitive to these distortions because it is integrated along the line of sight . \n below we show how our approach extends to measuring it . \n we work in the flat - sky approximation , where there is a single line of sight to all galaxies in the survey . sitting around a given central galaxy and projecting \n corresponds to drawing cylindrical shells around that central with bases that are concentric annuli . \n all of the galaxies in a given cylinder project down into the cylinder s base annulus . \n we thus have a planar problem with circular symmetry . \n this permits simplification of our spherical harmonic basis . recall that @xmath69 where here @xmath70 are the angular coordinates of a galaxy in the system where the central is at the origin . \n since all the ( projected ) positions are coplanar with the central , the separation along the @xmath71-axis is zero , so @xmath72 . defining @xmath73 we see from equation ( [ eqn : zetal_int ] ) that the multipole moments of the projected \n , radially binned 3pcf will simply involve fourier coefficients of the projected , radially binned density field weighted by @xmath74 : @xmath75 above , the integrals over @xmath76 and @xmath77 of equation ( [ eqn : zetal_int ] ) have already been performed using that the projected density field is only non - zero at @xmath78 .    with this in mind \n , we observe that if one is solely interested in the projected 3pcf , it is probably optimal simply to use the fourier basis directly . \n one parametrizes the projected 3pcf estimator about a given central as @xmath79 and writes the exponential as @xmath80 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are now angles in the plane in polar coordinates , with @xmath81 . using orthogonality of the plane waves , one \n may then extract the expansion coefficients @xmath82 in equation ( [ eqn : fourier_param ] ) as @xmath83 just as in the non - projected case , these integrals can be explicitly evaluated using the cartesian expressions for the exponentials , and precomputing @xmath84 and @xmath85 . \n again , one never explicitly considers pairs of galaxies about a given central ; one simply constructs the coefficients @xmath86 for all radial bins , then computes @xmath87 for all desired bin combinations , and finally averages over translations by integrating out @xmath39 . \n we should note that chen & szapudi ( 2005 ) advanced a similar scheme to measure the 3pcf of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) maps , analogous to the projected 3pcf since both are on 2-d manifolds . \n however their method evaluates the fourier transform of the ( continuous ) temperature anisotropy map by gridding , whereas here we suggest the ( discrete ) galaxy density field be fourier - transformed using direct evaluation of the cartesian expressions for @xmath84 and @xmath85 . \n surveys have jagged and complicated boundaries , and these can produce a spurious contribution to the 3pcf that is the signature of the survey geometry rather than physics the survey hopes to probe . \n this spurious contribution must be removed . in fourier space , \n boundaries lead to gibbs phenomenon ringing in the bispectrum , and are challenging to remove . \n however , in configuration space , edge correction is fairly straightforward for popular estimators ( see kayo et al . \n 2004 , appendix , for comparison of several ) . \n we focus here on the szapudi & szalay ( 1998 ) estimator , which kayo et al . \n ( 2004 ) find preferable to the others they consider ; it has now become the standard in the field . \n it is @xmath88 with @xmath89 , @xmath90 the data and @xmath91 the random counts . \n note that , if one inserted @xmath92 for @xmath93 in section [ sec : algorithm ] , one would need to compute integrals of this fraction against the spherical harmonics , requiring definition of @xmath92 at every point in space . \n however , the estimator ( [ eqn : hat_zeta_est ] ) really represents the function @xmath94 averaged over rotations and translations with weights @xmath95 , which in the shot noise limit is just inverse variance weighting ( we include radial binning represented by @xmath96 ) . in short \n , @xmath97 thus the estimator ( [ eqn : hat_zeta_est ] ) should be interpreted as demanding the triple count @xmath98 divided by the triple count @xmath99 . \n therefore we can insert @xmath4 and @xmath91 separately in turn for @xmath93 in section [ sec : algorithm ] , processing random and data catalogs serially . \n the division required can be done as a post - processing step . \n we now turn to how this division translates to the legendre basis . \n working now in our legendre basis , we have @xmath100 @xmath101 and @xmath102 inserting the multipole expansions ( [ eqn : mp_nr])-([eqn : mp_r ] ) into the estimator ( [ eqn : hat_zeta_est ] ) and multiplying through by @xmath99 we find @xmath103    using a linearization formula for the product of two legendre polynomials ( ferrers ( 1877 ) , adams ( 1878 ) , neumann ( 1878 ) , park & kim ( 2006 ) ; se15 equation ( a11 ) ) we find , with angular arguments suppressed , @xmath104 the wigner 3j - symbol above describes angular momentum coupling ; see e.g. brink & satchler ( 1993 ) or awh13 . \n the vector addition of angular momenta means that the upper row must satisfy triangle inequalities , so @xmath105 and at fixed @xmath16 and @xmath106 the sum is finite . using orthogonality , separating out the @xmath107 term , dividing through by @xmath108 , and defining @xmath109 \n , we obtain @xmath110    for a boundary - free survey the random field would generate only a monopole ( @xmath108 ) , leaving only @xmath111 on the righthand side ; this is the limit where there is no need for edge - correction , but just division by the randoms . \n the form of equation ( [ eqn : edgecorrxn_fund ] ) suggests that this problem can be cast as a matrix multiplication , so we define the multipole coupling matrix @xmath112 with elements @xmath113 note that while these matrix elements describe the off - diagonal couplings of different multipoles to each other , they need not be zero along the diagonal . \n a given multipole in the data may couple to that same multipole in @xmath114 because the 3j - symbol allows @xmath115 for @xmath116 . but the dominant coupling of a given multipole in the data to the same multipole in @xmath114 is described by @xmath111 in equation ( [ eqn : edgecorrxn_fund ] ) , since the @xmath117 are expected to be much less than unity . \n this term translates to the identity matrix @xmath118 . \n the edge - correction equation ( [ eqn : edgecorrxn_fund ] ) thus becomes @xmath119 where @xmath120 and analogously for @xmath121 . \n the system of equations this represents can then be solved for @xmath121 by matrix inversion .    to explore this matrix for a realistic use case \n , we use the lasdamas sdss dr7 real space mock catalogs , using 15 radial bins and a maximum scale of @xmath0 ( further details are given in section [ sec : mock_results ] ) . \n we show @xmath122 for a particular bin in @xmath123 in figure [ fig : mkl ] , and the leading order edge correction factor @xmath124 in figure [ fig : f_one ] . \n @xmath112 is not symmetric , but @xmath125 is ; this is why the upper off - diagonal , where @xmath126 , exceeds the lower in figure [ fig : mkl ] . \n there are two approximations implicit in our approach to solving equation ( [ eqn : matrix_edgecorrxn ] ) . \n first , to obtain a given matrix element @xmath122 , formally one requires @xmath117 for all values of @xmath106 . \n however , for @xmath127 these factors fall rapidly . for the lasdamas real space mock catalogs for which we present results here , they are @xmath128 by @xmath129 even for the largest - scale radial bin combination ( the values are listed in the caption to figure [ fig : mkl ] ) , so we simply truncate the series there . if one wished one could easily expand our code to measure higher multipoles of the randoms at the cost of slightly more computation time . \n however we expect that going to @xmath129 will already render the edge correction error negligible compared to the total error budget . \n importantly , the smallness of the @xmath117 for @xmath127 means that the coupling between multipoles @xmath130 and @xmath16 is nearly diagonal . \n coupling between multipoles separated by more than one angular momentum step is suppressed as @xmath131 or higher because the 3j - symbol in the coupling matrix elements ( [ eqn : mkl ] ) requires that @xmath132 . \n the second approximation relates to the matrix inversion when we solve equation ( [ eqn : matrix_edgecorrxn ] ) . \n formally one has an infinite dimensional matrix where at fixed @xmath16 , all @xmath130 enter the correction . \n thus this matrix will not be square ( and hence invertible ) unless we go to an infinite number of @xmath16 as well . \n however , in practice the matrix is so diagonally - dominant that we believe it is accurate enough simply to invert the sub - matrix given by truncating @xmath16 and @xmath130 at some maximum multipole . \n we verify this approximation by constructing @xmath122 using solely the dominant @xmath124 edge - correction factor , letting @xmath130 and @xmath16 go to @xmath133 , inverting , and comparing to the result where both go to @xmath134 . were the matrix purely diagonal \n , truncation would not affect the inverse at all . in the limit where only @xmath124 is non - zero ( in reality , \n it does dominate the other edge correction factors ) , the matrix is tridiagonal , and so truncation at @xmath134 affects @xmath135 at order @xmath124 , @xmath136 at order @xmath137 , and @xmath138 at order @xmath139 .      using a simple toy model , we can estimate the edge correction factors @xmath140 to confirm that they really should be small . consider a spherical ball of random galaxies with radius @xmath91 about a given central , and assume this sphere is cut by a planar survey boundary . \n orient the @xmath71-axis perpendicular to this boundary , with the central galaxy a distance @xmath71 from it . \n the problem now has symmetry about this axis , so we need only compute the @xmath141 spherical harmonic coefficients @xmath65 ; @xmath142 , with @xmath143 . for a galaxy at distance @xmath91 from the central \n , there will be some critical angle with cosine @xmath144 such that , for smaller @xmath145 , the galaxy is outside the survey . \n we have @xmath146 . \n \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we used the recursion formula @xmath147 $ ] to evaluate the integral and noted that the terms at the lower bound cancel off because they have the same parity . \n we now compute the @xmath148 required by equations ( [ eqn : almsdef ] ) and ( [ eqn : zetal_int ] ) and average over @xmath149 ( denoted by angle brackets ) . \n we have @xmath150.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since each term above has even parity , we can integrate from @xmath151 to @xmath152 , divide by @xmath153 , and then invoke orthogonality , to find that @xmath154 finally , we compute @xmath155 explicitly , to find that @xmath156 @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , falling to @xmath161 . it should be kept in mind that in a large survey volume such as sdss , many centrals will have spheres around them that do not impinge on a large - scale survey boundary at all , further reducing these factors ; for instance , for the sdss boss dr10 footprint only of order @xmath162 of spheres impinge on a boundary , so our rough estimates should be scaled down by a factor of 5 . \n on the other hand , the true survey mask is far more complicated than the simple planar boundary model above , so this model should not be taken too literally .    ) for the lasdamas sdss dr7 real space mock catalogs with 15 radial bins out to @xmath0 . \n higher @xmath163 fall off very rapidly . \n even the leading order coefficient is small . \n this means that one does not need to measure many multipoles of the randoms to obtain a highly accurate edge correction : since the higher @xmath117 fall off so rapidly they contribute very little to the matrix @xmath112 that must be inverted ( equation ( [ eqn : matrix_edgecorrxn ] ) ) . \n as we expect , @xmath124 becomes larger at larger scales , as larger scale triangles are more likely to impinge on a survey boundary . ]    ) at each @xmath130 and @xmath16 for the largest combination of radial bins we test here . \n this illustrates that all of the couplings are @xmath164 , even for the largest scales we test , which should have the largest correction factors as they are most likely to impinge on a survey boundary ( see figure [ fig : f_one ] ) . while the diagonal appears zero in this plot , it is actually just small , as we discuss in the main text . \n the @xmath140 entering the matrix elements @xmath122 for this radial bin combination are @xmath165 , and @xmath166 \n we next describe our c++ implementation of the ideas in sections [ sec : algorithm ] and [ sec : edgecorrxn ] . \n the basic program flow is to loop over each central galaxy . for each \n , we find all neighbors within @xmath2  and accumulate the @xmath65 for each of the radial bins . once finished with the neighbor finding , we compute all of the bin cross - powers and add them to our accumulators as a function of bins @xmath10 and @xmath11 and multipole @xmath16 . \n all of the accumulations include a user - supplied weight per galaxy . \n we accelerate the finding of neighbors by sorting the particles into a grid , so that the search for neighbors need only consider grid cells that include some point closer than @xmath167 . \n ideally one wants the grid spacing to be a few times smaller than @xmath167 , so that the inefficiency of doing a cubic search for a spherical region is mild . \n one also wants the grid spacing to be large enough to contain at least several particles , so that the overhead of storing and accessing the grid is modest . \n these criteria are not hard to satisfy : for the lasdamas mocks , we use a grid spacing of @xmath168 when searching out to @xmath169 ; this typically contains a dozen galaxies ( and somewhat more random points ) . for the sdss - iii baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey , the density is three times higher . \n once a neighbor is found , we need to add its contribution to the spherical harmonics . \n we do not use an angular binning to compute the spherical harmonics . \n rather , as mentioned in section [ sec : algorithm ] , we use the fact that the spherical harmonics can be written as powers of the cartesian coordinates of unit vectors . \n in particular , for a unit vector @xmath170 , we can write @xmath171 as a polynomial of terms of the form @xmath172 where @xmath173 . to compute all @xmath65 up to multipole order @xmath174 , we therefore accumulate sums over all neighbors of the cartesian powers @xmath172 with @xmath175 , using the unit vectors of the separation of the neighbor from the central galaxy . \n there are @xmath176 such power combinations for each radial bin . \n having finished with all neighbors , we convert these powers into the @xmath65 using the appropriate coefficients from the spherical harmonics , then form all of the bin - to - bin cross powers .    for values of @xmath174 of order 10 , \n the computation of the cartesian powers is much faster than doing the spherical harmonic transform of a fine angular grid . \n this is particularly true because we use custom assembly code , supplied by marc metchnik as part of the abacus project ( metchnik & pinto , in prep . ) , to accumulate these powers using advanced vector extension ( avx ) instructions . in double precision , \n 8 neighbors are computed at once , using two sets of avx registers . \n though we do not present the 3pcf measurement here , we also run our algorithm on the sdss - iii boss dr10 data . in the north galactic cap footprint for the cmass sample \n , we consider the rrr count of 642,619 random particles . \n we count 6.7 billion pairs with @xmath177 , an average of 10,400 neighbors per central , divided into 10 linearly spaced radial bins . using @xmath178 \n , the code runs in 170 seconds on a 6-core 4.2 ghz i7 - 3930k . \n if we use @xmath179 , thereby reducing the problem to the pair finding and a simple accumulation per radial bin , then the code runs in 53 seconds . \n loading the particles and sorting them into the grid is a small fraction of that total , so we infer that each pair found and processed at @xmath179 takes about 200 clock cycles . \n given @xmath178 , we have 286 powers to track per neighbor , each requiring a separate multiply and add . \n hence , we are computing about 3.8 trillion double - precision operations in 120 extra seconds , a rate of 32 double - precision gflops . \n this is about 30% of the maximum performance of the cpu ( assuming 4 double precision operations in avx per clock cycle per core ) , a high mark for a practical calculation . \n the code is sustaining 22 gflops for the full problem , including the pair finding . \n a two - point correlation function code would only need to count half as many pairs , since the particles are indistinguishable in that application , and so at these speeds would take of order @xmath180 seconds . \n we therefore find that our computation of the three - point correlation function up to @xmath181 is only about @xmath182 times slower than the equivalent two - point correlation function calculation . \n we would expect an explicit counting of triples to be about 3,000 times slower than the two - point pair counting , given the 10,000 neighbors ( divide by a factor of 3 for the number of indistinguishable triples compared to indistinguishable pairs ) . as our method is only six times slower than a two - point measurement , it is a factor of five hundred faster than an explicit triple count for this large - scale example .    in any method that compares the data points to a random set , we have to consider the effect of poisson noise in the randoms . \n for example , in the landy - szalay ( 1993 ) estimator for the two - point function , @xmath183 , we will have noise in the data - random @xmath184 and random - random @xmath185 counts that would go to zero in the limit of infinite numbers of random points . \n one therefore usually wants to use many more randoms than data ( but note the important optimization presented in padmanabhan et al . \n ( 2007 ) in which one fits these counts to smooth functions of scale so as to reduce the poisson noise ) . \n a common inefficiency , however , is to use the same number of randoms for each of the terms . \n this results in spending far too much computational resource on @xmath186 , whose poisson noise will be dwarfed by the @xmath187 noise . for example , if the number of randoms is @xmath60 times the number of data points , then ( assuming uniform galaxy weights ) the variance on @xmath186 will be @xmath188 of that of @xmath189 since the number of @xmath186 pairs is @xmath190 the number of @xmath189 pairs . \n in contrast , the variance of @xmath187 will only be reduced to @xmath191 of that of @xmath189 ; the factor of 4 comes from the factor of 2 in the landy - szalay estimator , and the @xmath192 enters because the @xmath189 and @xmath186 pairs have double the variance since each pair is counted twice . meanwhile the work in the two terms is scaling as @xmath193 and @xmath60 , respectively .    a simple way to avoid \n this is to compute the @xmath187 and @xmath186 counts with a smaller set of randoms and then repeat this numerous times , averaging over the answers . by choosing the number of randoms in each set \n , one can optimize the work . \n for example , in the above two - point case , at fixed total work , the number of random catalogs @xmath194 one can use scales as @xmath195 . \n the total variance scales as the variance per random catalog divided by @xmath194 , so as @xmath196 . \n this is minimized for @xmath197 , i.e. , it is optimal to use random catalogs equal in size to the data set . \n a further advantage of this method is that in addition to averaging all of the sets to get the best answer , one can compute the variance to explicitly measure the contribution of the random catalog density relative to one s estimate of the irreducible on - sky variance .    for our three - point algorithm , \n the work scales as @xmath198 , while the poisson variance of @xmath199 for each random catalog scales as @xmath200 for @xmath99 and @xmath201 for @xmath202 and @xmath203 ; the @xmath204 enters due to the @xmath205 in the szapudi - szalay estimator , while the @xmath206 comes from a 6-fold counting symmetry in @xmath207 and @xmath99 compared to a 2-fold one in @xmath203 and @xmath202 . \n the total variance is thus @xmath208 . at fixed total work \n @xmath194 scales as @xmath209 , and so the total variance scales as @xmath210 . \n this is minimized for @xmath211 but with only @xmath212 variation between @xmath213 and @xmath153 . \n we implement this strategy in our three - point method by supplying a single list of particles , with the randoms concatenated to the data but with negative weights . \n notationally , this is @xmath214 , as in section [ sec : edgecorrxn ] . \n we then compute the three - point correlations of this @xmath4 list . \n we then re - run repeatedly with new random points @xmath91 . \n we avoid the small amount of repeated counting of the @xmath189 pairs and @xmath207 triples by the following trick . \n we first run the code with only the data particle list and save a file that contains the cartesian multipoles for each radial bin and each primary particle , in the enumerated order of the particles . when next running with @xmath215 lists , whenever a data particle is the primary ( as marked by its having a non - negative weight ) , we initialize the multipole accumulators with the saved values and then skip any secondary particles that are also from the data list . the resulting sums pass transparently to the rest of the analysis code . \n we also run a separate case with only the randoms , so that we can compute the denominator and edge - correction terms in equation ( [ eqn : edgecorrxn_fund ] ) . \n this requires much less precision , as the denominator of the estimator is much larger than the numerator for large - scale correlations . \n we therefore do this with only a single set of random points . \n finally , we have also written a python implementation of the algorithm presented here and tested it on a periodic box with sides of @xmath216 containing @xmath217 galaxies ( roughly the sdss boss number density ) . rather than using gridding , \n this code exploits kd - trees for galaxy finding , using a fast c implementation ( wrapped to python ) in the @xmath218 library within @xmath219 . \n we verified the accuracy of this code on a sample of 500 galaxies by comparing with a simple direct - counting algorithm that just counts triplets and then projects onto multipoles . \n this provides an important cross check on our spherical harmonics since the simple triple counting never uses spherical harmonics . \n we then ran both the multipole python code and the multipole c++ code on a larger , 20,000 galaxy sample to verify the c++ code . \n runtime for the python version on a dual core ( 2014 ) macbook air was about @xmath220 minutes ; since the box is periodic , scaling to larger numbers of galaxies is linear . \n parameter fitting requires weighting the data points according to how independent they are , with two highly independent points contributing more than two less independent points all else equal . \n the covariance matrix describes how independent the measured multipoles at each @xmath123 are . for our algorithm to be useful \n , we must show that the covariance matrix can be controlled ; here we compute it with this end in mind . \n the general 3pcf covariance has been computed before ( szapudi 2001 ) as a 6-d integral , but it is not straightforward to obtain the covariance of our multipole decomposition from this result . here \n we derive the covariance for our multipole decomposition and show that it can be reduced to a sum of 2-d integrals . \n this reduction offers a significant improvement in the computation speed possible at a given accuracy . \n we begin with some definitions and conventions . \n while we wish to compute the covariance matrix of the configuration space 3pcf , we will end up working in fourier space to do the computation because simplifications are available there by appeal to the power spectrum . \n we define the fourier transform as @xmath221 with inverse @xmath222 for the earlier stages of our computation we will in fact need to use the discrete fourier transform and its inverse , defined as @xmath223 and @xmath224 where these discrete transforms are over a volume @xmath225 with quantized wavenumbers such that @xmath226 , @xmath227 . \n we define the power spectrum as @xmath228 @xmath26 is the kronecker delta , unity when its argument is zero and zero otherwise . \n one can check easily that this definition allows one to recover the familiar relation that the correlation function is the fourier transform of the power spectrum . \n we will also use the fact that @xmath229    finally , note that one can convert from the discrete to the continous case by replacing @xmath230 with @xmath231 . \n we now obtain the covariance of our multipole decomposition of the 3pcf . here \n we begin with an estimator for the translation - averaged but not rotation - averaged full 3pcf ; we will project onto multipoles ( which also averages over rotations ) and bin radially later . \n @xmath232 for a gaussian random field , @xmath233 . \n the covariance is thus @xmath234\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times

spherical harmonics using awh13 equation ( 16.61 ) and expanding the legendre polynomial in spherical harmonics using the spherical harmonic addition theorem ( [ eqn : sph_addition_theorem ] ) ; the

the six triangles inside the curly brackets above represent the six terms in the curly brackets . \n the legendre polynomials are always evaluated about a particular vertex , as shown in the diagram , and the real - space variables match to fourier - space variables differently in each triangle ( see equation ( [ eqn : sumdone ] ) ) . \n one can see from above that each pair of triangles , or pair of terms in curly brackets in equation ( [ eqn : proj_covar_qp ] ) , has switch symmetry @xmath262 . \n these are rotation symmetries about the vertex between @xmath263 and @xmath264 in each pair . \n one can also see that if we switch @xmath265 and @xmath266 , the leftmost triangle is symmetric \n . the topmost pair will also be symmetric under this switch as well , which is why it gives rise to two symmetric projection integrals , but the middle and bottom pairs will not be , which is why they give rise to four asymmetric projection integrals ( see equation ( [ eqn : covar_ito_ints ] ) ) . ]    to evaluate these angular integrals , we write the dirac delta as the fourier transform of unity , @xmath267}(\\vec{k}+\\vec{p}+\\vec{q})=\\int d^3\\vec{r}\\;e^{i\\left[\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}+\\vec{p}\\cdot\\vec{r}+\\vec{q}\\cdot\\vec{r}\\right]}\\ ] ] expand each exponential in spherical harmonics using awh13 equation ( 16.61 ) , and perform the angular integral over @xmath268 . \n defining @xmath269 we obtain @xmath270}(\\vec{k}+\\vec{p}+\\vec{q})=\\nonumber\\\\ & \\left(4\\pi\\right)^{3}\\sum_{l_{1}l_{2}l_{3},m_{1}m_{2}m_{3}}\\mathcal{d}_{l_{1}l_{2}l_{3}}\\mathcal{c}_{l_{1}l_{2}l_{3}}\\mathcal{r}_{l_{1}l_{2}l_{3}}(k , p , q)\\nonumber\\\\ &

equivalent to mehrem ( 2002 ) equation ( 5.1 ) if the 3j - symbols above are translated to clebsch - gordan symbols . \n inserting equation ( [ eqn : delta_as_ylms ] ) into equation ( [ eqn : projxn_integrals ] ) and then expanding the legendre polynomials in equation ( [ eqn : projxn_integrals ] ) into spherical harmonics using the spherical harmonic addition theorem ( [ eqn : sph_addition_theorem ] ) , we now simply have integrals over products of three spherical harmonics , which can be done analytically with 3j - symbols . \n the result can then be simplified by explicitly evaluating some of the 3j - symbols ( using nist digital library of mathematical functions ( dlmf ) 34.3.1 ) and summing over all of the spin angular momenta ( using nist dlmf 34.3.10 and 34.3.18 ) . for the symmetric \n integral we find @xmath271 where we have separated @xmath130 with a semicolon because it is the only argument that does not appear in the legendre polynomials in the integral . \n a simple case to check is setting @xmath107 and @xmath272 in equation ( [ eqn : projxn_integrals ] ) . \n then @xmath273 so by direct computation @xmath274}(p - q)}{q^2 } \\label{eqn : symm_direct}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used @xmath275 . in equation ( [ eqn : symm_int ] ) , \n @xmath107 sets @xmath276 and the 3j - symbol s square is @xmath277 . using the orthogonality relation for spherical bessel functions , @xmath278}(p - q)/(2q^2)$ ] ; inserting this in equation ( [ eqn : symm_int ] ) and simplifying yields agreement with the direct computation .    for the asymmetric integral \n we find @xmath279 where now @xmath174 is separated by a semicolon because it appeared in two legendre polynomials in the integrand . \n note that for @xmath107 , the symmetric and asymmetric integrals of equation ( [ eqn : projxn_integrals ] ) are equal , so equation ( [ eqn : asymm_int ] ) should reduce to equation ( [ eqn : symm_int ] ) in this limit , as can be verified by noting @xmath107 implies @xmath280 . \n thus @xmath281    we now interchange the order of integration so that the integrals over @xmath282 and @xmath130 are done first , since they are separable , and the linking integral over @xmath46 implied by @xmath283 is done last . \n we also make the sum over @xmath284 explicit and do it after evaluating the @xmath282 and @xmath130 integrals . \n finally we define @xmath285 and @xmath286 in terms of these functions , @xmath287+(-1)^{(l+l'+l_{2})/2}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times\\bigg[f_{ll}(r;r_{1})f_{l'l'}(r;r_{1}')f_{l_{2}ll'}(r;r_{2},r_{2}')\\nonumber\\\\ &

@xmath289 , as expected . \n we have thus shown how to reduce the covariance of our multipole decomposition to a sum of 2-d integrals . \n this is a significant computational benefit : the @xmath290 and @xmath291 can be pre - computed once to give all the terms in the sum above , and then integrated over @xmath292 . \n further , since the problem is now 2-d one can simply evaluate the integrals using a grid and avoid appealing to more complicated higher - dimensional integration techniques .    in closing , we note that for @xmath293 ( i.e. @xmath294 ) , @xmath290 and @xmath295 can be computed analytically . \n we find @xmath296 using @xmath297 and gradshteyn & ryzhik ( 2007 ) equation ( 6.512.1 ) . \n @xmath298 is the hypergeometric function and we assume @xmath299 ; the result for @xmath300 is given by switching @xmath301 . \n @xmath295 can be computed using techniques outlined in fabrikant ( 2013 ) and is given by his equation ( 9 ) ; since the expression is rather long we do not reproduce it here . \n we mention this since one could imagine scenarios in which high speed was desirable for computing the covariance , such that these approximate forms might suffice . finally , \n to incorporate shot noise in the covariance , one takes @xmath302 , @xmath5 the survey number density . \n this will introduce a cross term where one of the @xmath290 or @xmath295 in each pair in equation ( [ eqn : fullcovar_final ] ) no longer involves the power spectrum , and also a term in @xmath303 where both functions in each pair do not . \n the required integrals are also analytic : @xmath304}(r - r_1),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while @xmath295 is rather longer and given by mehrem ( 2002 ) equation ( 5.14 ) , assuming a much simpler form ( his equation ( 5.15 ) ) if @xmath305 , or @xmath306 . \n the above calculation used exact values for @xmath307 and @xmath308 , but we can easily integrate over bins in radius . \n we simply integrate the @xmath295 and @xmath290 functions defined above over bins , equivalent to replacing @xmath309 and @xmath310 with their bin - averaged values . \n we define @xmath311 and @xmath312 with @xmath313 where @xmath314 is a dummy variable and we recall that @xmath315 is the binning function ensuring @xmath314 is in the bin @xmath316 ( see section [ subsec : binning ] ) . \n we display the binned reduced covariance , @xmath317 for fixed @xmath318 and a number of @xmath319 and @xmath320 combinations in figure [ fig : covar_grid ] . \n one can see clear features when @xmath321 , especially when @xmath322 as well ( e.g. the 11 , 22 , 33 , and 44 panels ) . \n the computation was done in @xmath323 bins but we display with an interpolated color scheme because the underlying radial variables are continuous , in contrast to the multipoles @xmath16 and @xmath106 . \n we used the linear - theory matter power spectrum from camb ( lewis 2000 ) and checked convergence of the integrals by varying the endpoints and spacing of the grids in @xmath46 and @xmath130 we used . \n cosmology with @xmath324 , and @xmath325 . ] for the spherical bessel functions we used high - order taylor series for small values of the arguments , with the change - over point to the series depending on the order @xmath16 , and cross - checked with direct computation using _ \n scipy s _ built - in functions . for the @xmath326 ( equation ( [ eqn : jlbar ] ) ) we used analytical results , \n cross - checked with numerical integrations of the @xmath327 .    in figure \n [ fig : covar_diag_grid ] , we show the binned covariance when @xmath328 and @xmath329 versus all @xmath16 and @xmath106 , and for a number of choices of @xmath330 and @xmath308 , indicated in the upper left of each panel . notice that the strongest covariance is , as one might expect , when @xmath322 as well , along the diagonal . \n we display with no color interpolation because the multipoles are discrete . \n we show larger radial bins than the lasdamas mock results contain because these will be relevant for the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) scale analysis planned for future work . \n we present the results of running our algorithm on the publicly available lasdamas mock catalogs for the sdss - ii dr7 in both real and redshift space . \n we used 15 radial bins with @xmath331 . \n we show first the results at each multipole versus the two triangle side lengths @xmath10 and @xmath11 in figure [ fig:3pcf_colorgrid ] . \n this shows that the largest amplitude contribution to the 3pcf , especially for triangles well away from the diagonal , is @xmath332 . \n this is what we expect from se15 , figure 9 , third row , leftmost panel , showing the perturbation theory results and focusing on the linear bias @xmath333 , which dominates the non - linear bias @xmath334 . in @xmath335 \n , there is a hint of a large - scale decrement , to be compared with the slight feature close to the diagonal around @xmath336 in se15 figure 9 , second row , leftmost panel .    as in se15 , \n @xmath332 and @xmath337 look similar but with @xmath332 having higher amplitude away from the diagonal . for @xmath338 , \n the panels all begin to look the same , agreeing with our expectation from se15 figure 9 . \n this is because these higher multipoles , in particular near the diagonal , are dominated by a small population of squeezed triangles where two sides are equal ( e.g. @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and the third side nears zero . in the hierarchical ansatz for the 3pcf \n , one has @xmath339 , so we expect the amplitude to become very large as any side approaches zero . \n also discussed in se15 is another reason for the similarity of the @xmath338 panels : before cyclic summing over vertices of the triangle , the leading order pre - cyclic perturbation theory 3pcf only has structure for @xmath340 . in particular , at leading ( fourth ) order , the 3pcf receives one contribution from the second - order density field , @xmath341 , which is in turn calculated by integrating a kernel @xmath342 against the linear density field ( goroff et al . \n 1986 ; jain & bertschinger 1994 ; bernardeau et al . \n this kernel has only @xmath343 , and @xmath153 terms . if one chooses the second - order density point to be at the origin , the 3pcf therefore has multipole structure only to @xmath332 . in reality \n we do not know which point contributes @xmath341 , so we must cyclically sum around the triangle and can not choose @xmath341 at the origin . \n this cyclic summing generates additional angular structure , but it just stems from the geometric effect of writing a simple @xmath344 and @xmath153-only multipole expansion with argument e.g. @xmath345 in terms of @xmath346 . \n we note that the @xmath343 , and @xmath153 terms that enter pre - cyclically have a physical meaning . \n @xmath342 is formed by summing two mode - coupling kernels @xmath347 and @xmath348 ( bernardeau et al . \n 2002 equations ( 39 ) and ( 156 ) ) . \n these in turn come from solving respectively the full continuity equation and the euler equation ( compare bernardeau et al . \n 2002 equations ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) with their equations ( 37 ) and ( 38 ) ) . \n @xmath347 produces all of the @xmath349 and @xmath350 of the @xmath335 terms in @xmath342 . \n the @xmath349 contribution is from the product of the velocity divergence and the density , while the @xmath335 contribution is from gradients of the density field parallel to the velocity . \n meanwhile , @xmath348 generates the remaining @xmath351 of the @xmath335 term and all of the @xmath332 term in @xmath342 ; these stem from gradients of the velocity divergence parallel to the velocity . \n figures [ fig : recon ] and [ fig : ratios ] show that the full 3pcf of the data can be reconstructed well from only a few multipoles . \n figure [ fig : recon ] reconstructs the 3pcf from coefficients \n @xmath15 , up to and including the @xmath16 indicated in the legend , for a particular triangle configuration with @xmath352 , @xmath353 . \n one recovers an accurate shape versus @xmath354 even using only multipoles up to @xmath355 , and that adding in @xmath356 and finally @xmath357 changes the shape very little . in figure \n [ fig : ratios ] , we illustrate the same idea for three different triangle configurations : the higher multipoles fall off relative to @xmath358 , meaning they contribute less to reconstructing the full 3pcf . \n this plot likely is conservative in that it makes the effect of the higher multipoles appear larger than it is ; the plot shows the ratio of each higher multipole to @xmath358 , but the change in the 3pcf produced by adding in a higher multipole is actually roughly the ratio of the multipole to the sum of _ all _ the lower multipoles . since , in detail , legendre polynomial weights also enter , one might consider an angle - averaged version of this ratio . however since figure [ fig : recon ] effectively already shows the unimportance of the highest multipoles , we have in figure [ fig : ratios ] just chosen to show @xmath359 because it offers more granular information . \n indicated in the legend , as described in section [ sec : mock_results ] . \n the reconstruction converges even for modest @xmath16 . \n the @xmath360 points lie essentially directly under those for @xmath181 . ] \n coefficients to @xmath358 for several triangle configurations ( again using the lasdamas real space mocks ) . \n the decline of the higher multipoles with @xmath16 indicates that not many multipoles are needed for accurately reconstructing the full 3pcf . \n this is especially true for the largest scale triangle we show , which is also the least likely to be altered by non - linear effects . \n the relative magnitudes of the higher multipoles here may seem large when recalling from figure [ fig : recon ] that the reconstruction appears well converged by @xmath355 ; but note that a given multipole s contribution to the reconstruction is roughly its ratio to the sum of all the lower multipoles , not just to @xmath358 ; this reduces the importance of the higher multipoles . \n finally , the strength of @xmath332 shows the quadratic or u - shaped behavior of the 3pcf traditionally associated with gravitational growth of structure ( see also figure [ fig : recon ] ) . \n gravity generates gradients of the density and velocity divergence mostly parallel to the velocity , in turn enhancing roughly collinear structures with @xmath96 near @xmath361 or @xmath362 ( bernardeau et al . 2002 ) . ] \n se15 presented a compression scheme for the multipole moments of the 3pcf . \n this was designed to avoid the squeezed limit where two galaxies are so nearby that perturbation theory is invalid and also to reduce the dimension of the covariance matrix required for parameter fitting . \n this approach integrated each multipole moment over @xmath11 from @xmath363 at each value of @xmath10 .    in the current work \n the data is binned coarsely enough in both @xmath10 and @xmath11 that this approach must be adapted slightly . \n we simply choose to , for a given bin @xmath10 , sum over all bins with @xmath364 . \n @xmath365 is the set of all bins in @xmath11 where @xmath11 is greater than @xmath366 and less than @xmath367 . \n one might wish to select a different multiple of @xmath368 in defining @xmath369 . \n ] this assures that the minimum value of @xmath11 is @xmath370 and that the minimum difference between @xmath10 and @xmath11 is also @xmath370 , meaning by the triangle inequality that @xmath371 . \n this avoids the squeezed limit while reducing the dimension of the problem . \n mathematically , the compression is defined here as    @xmath372    where bar denotes `` binned '' , superscript `` c '' denotes `` compression '' , and @xmath373 is the @xmath374 binned 3pcf multipole ( see section [ subsec : binning ] ) . \n @xmath375 is the volume of bin @xmath11 . \n the denominator is for normalization .    in figures [ fig : low_ell_comps ] and [ fig : hi_ell_comps ] we show the results of this compression . \n we also compressed the leading ( fourth ) order perturbation theory predictions , calculated as outlined in se15 , and show them for comparison . \n the theory requires linear ( @xmath333 ) and non - linear ( @xmath334 ) bias parameters as an input ; we use a least - squares fit with points weighted by the inverse compressed variance . this latter \n is computed from the scatter between mocks and ignores noise in the random catalog used for edge correction , which due to the large number of randoms is negligible . \n our mocks constitute a volume of order 7 times that used for the theoretical covariance calculation here , so , as explained in figure [ fig : covar_diag_grid ] , we might expect error bars on the compressions of order @xmath376 . \n this is indeed what we find . \n we offer the caveat that a full , rigorously correct fit of theory to observation would require inversion of the full covariance matrix . \n we leave this for future work ; here our goal is simply to indicate that the results of our algorithm roughly agree with perturbation theory predictions .    using the simple procedure above , the results are well - fit with @xmath377 and @xmath378 ; note that to compute the theory predictions we matched the lasdamas cosmology . \n there is quoted at @xmath379 ; @xmath380 . \n the lasdamas mocks are at @xmath381 , so when normalizing the power spectrum we should use @xmath382 $ ] , with @xmath90 the linear growth factor ( e.g. mo van den bosch & white ( 2010 ) equations ( 4.75 ) , ( 4.76 ) , and ( 3.77 ) ; carroll et al . \n ( 1992 ) ) . \n ] there is some deviation noticeable at large scales in @xmath349 ( about @xmath383 ) and @xmath335 ( about @xmath384 ) , with nearly all the other multipoles deviating only within the error bars or at most in a few cases just slightly outside them . \n the larger deviations in @xmath349 and @xmath335 are likely because non - linear corrections to the perturbation theory results can not be neglected . \n in particular , in @xmath349 we expect non - linear evolution might smooth structure on smaller scales , making the slope of the perturbation theory compression shallower and allowing a better global fit to the @xmath349 mock results . \n importantly , the error bars become much larger for @xmath385 as compared to those for @xmath386 . \n this suggests when doing a full parameter fit using the covariance matrix , one might not gain much by including these higher multipoles . \n one might choose simply to drop these modes to reduce the dimension of the covariance matrix to be inverted . \n figures [ fig : low_ell_comps ] and [ fig : hi_ell_comps ] also show that the redshift space results at each multipole appear to be roughly a constant rescaling of the real space results , with a constant that only weakly depends on the multipole . to illustrate this we show the ratio of redshift space to real space results in each radial bin at each multipole ( figure [ fig : redshift_space_rescale ] , left panel ) and the radially - averaged ratio versus multipole ( figure [ fig : redshift_space_rescale ] , right panel ) . \n more detailed discussion is in the caption to this figure ; the key point is that for @xmath387 , there is little radial dependence to the rescaling factor and also little multipole dependence . \n both dependences are more pronounced for @xmath388 ; we suspect this is because these higher multipoles are dominated , even in the compression , by a small subset of relatively squeezed triangles that are more strongly affected by rsd . \n this issue might merit further attention in subsequent work .            ) . \n the right panel shows the radial average at each multipole . while there is some radial scale dependence in the left panel , it is modest for all but @xmath388 . thus averaging over the radial dependence does not lose much information for the lower multipoles . \n the averages ( right panel ) are similar for all but @xmath388 , and even these differ by less than a factor of 2 from the averages of the lower multipoles . ]      given that we now have compressed data , we must also apply our compression scheme as in the previous section to the binned covariance of section [ subsec : binning ] . \n we denote the compressed , binned covariance as @xmath389 , noting that the two superscript `` c ' 's denote that we compress over @xmath11 and @xmath308 , leaving the quantity a function only of @xmath10 and @xmath330 . \n it would be computationally intensive to compute the binned covariance using equation ( [ eqn : fullcovar_final ] ) with the @xmath290 and @xmath295 replaced by equations ( [ eqn : flbar_2])-([eqn : jlbar ] ) and then compress , and a faster approach is available . \n this is to compress @xmath390 and @xmath391 as necessary first and from them obtain the compressed binned covariance . \n @xmath390 need only be compressed at most once ( if its argument is @xmath11 or @xmath308 ) , but @xmath391 may be compressed once or twice depending on if one or both of its arguments have subscript @xmath153 . \n we thus define three functions , where `` cc '' again denotes a double compression :    @xmath392    note that in the second line above , the @xmath391 being compressed is a function @xmath10 and @xmath393 , and hence need only be compressed once \n it is not compressed over @xmath10 . \n however in the third line above , the @xmath391 being compressed depends on @xmath11 and @xmath308 and so must be compressed twice . \n making these replacements as appropriate in equation ( [ eqn : fullcovar_final ] ) yields the compressed , binned covariance . \n this shows that the framework of compression can be easily generalized to the covariance . \n we have presented a novel algorithm to compute the multipole moments of the 3pcf . \n it is especially apt for large cosmological datasets such as sdss and upcoming surveys like euclid , large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) , and dark energy spectroscopic instrument ( desi ) , which will have tens of millions to billions of objects ( jain et al . 2015 ) . for these datasets , \n an approach that scales with @xmath394 would be wholly infeasible . \n we have shown that our algorithm scales as @xmath395 , handles edge correction easily , and permits computation of the 3pcf of a large dataset quickly even with modest computing resources . \n we have also computed the covariance matrix of this decomposition in the gaussian random field limit . \n finally , we have developed the compression scheme first presented in se15 and shown its application both to the data and to the covariance matrix . \n this compression scheme offers a compelling way to visualize the results of the algorithm that loses little information , in contrast to the plots of the 3pcf or reduced 3pcf versus opening angle @xmath96 for particular triangle configurations that previous literature supplies . \n the algorithm presented here is unique in that it fundamentally reduces the scaling of the 3pcf measurement to that of the two - point function , while remaining exact in angle . \n this did not have to be the case . \n formally , for a complete representation of the 3pcf , one needs an infinite number of multipoles @xmath16 . \n however , because the physics generating the 3pcf does not have a great deal of angular structure , in practice a finite , modest number of multipoles suffices . \n furthermore , we have shown that in our lasdamas test case , the 3pcf is already well - reconstructed by @xmath355 ( figure [ fig : recon ] ) . since our algorithm fundamentally requires pair - counting , using a fast fourier transform ( fft ) for this step may in some cases offer an additional acceleration ; we present this in slepian & eisenstein 2015c . \n finally , one might worry that jagged survey boundaries could easily introduce high multipoles into the measured 3pcf . \n but we have shown that the coefficients required for the edge correction , at least for our lasdamas test case , fall off quickly enough that one need only measure a few multipoles of the randoms for an accurate solution ( figures [ fig : f_one ] and [ fig : mkl ] ) . \n the 3pcf contains important information on the non - gaussianity of large - scale structure ( lss ) due to growth under gravity and also perhaps that remaining from primordial non - gaussianity . with measurements of only the 2-point function , the amplitude of clustering ( e.g. @xmath1 ) and the linear bias are degenerate \n however , the 3pcf is sensitive to a different power of the linear bias than the 2-point function ( cube versus square ) , and so measuring it exposes a raw factor of the bias and helps break this degeneracy . as for primordial non - gaussianity , while the cmb has been the dominant constraint up to now ( see ade et al . \n ( 2015 ) ) , it is expected that even maximally improved cmb measurements can only enhance the cmb constraint by a factor of a few . \n thus lss will become a vital complementary probe . \n generically , inflation must couple to ordinary matter so as to produce it during reheating , and this coupling produces some level of non - gaussianity ( desjacques & seljak 2010 , for a recent review ) . thus the 3pcf can be used to probe the dynamics of inflation in principle  and perhaps , soon , in practice . \n the 3pcf also contains information on redshift space distortions . \n it should be emphasized that in the current work , the multipole moments are averaged over rotations of the triangle configurations , and so we lose any information about anisotropy . \n however , our algorithm can easily be adapted to retain the full , unaveraged information ( @xmath65s ) around each possible origin . \n this would allow tracing the anisotropy rsd induce . \n preliminary calculations indicate that rsd introduce couplings between multipoles @xmath396 which are absent without rsd . \n these couplings have selection rules due to the underlying symmetries under rotation about the line of sight and parity flips . \n there will also be @xmath60 dependence induced by the preferred direction defined by the line - of - sight . \n we therefore expect that the off - diagonal terms in a tensor of spherical harmonic coefficients will have structure that can be used to probe rsd - induced anisotropies . \n it is already important that the spherical harmonics , with the introduction of @xmath397 and @xmath60 , offer a natural 5-d basis for redshift - space measurements . \n work on these questions from both analytic and numerical perspectives is underway . \n we plan to apply our algorithm and analysis approach to sdss dr12 , with the goals of assessing the presence of bao features , measuring the linear and non - linear bias , and constraining the baryon - dark matter relative velocity ( tseliakhovich & hirata 2010 ; yoo , dalal & seljak 2011 ; yoo & seljak 2013 ; se15 ) . \n previous literature has found a bao feature in the reduced 3pcf @xmath398 , with @xmath399 the 2pcf ( gaztaaga et al . 2009 ) . that work used only one triangle configuration , @xmath400 and @xmath401 . with the additional \n signal - to - noise the large number of galaxies in sdss dr12 offers , as well as our algorithm s ability to consider all triangle configurations quickly , this problem is ripe for revisiting . furthermore , se15 suggests that the multipole decomposition clearly isolates a strong bao feature , especially in the @xmath335 multipole . \n this is also a particularly informative multipole for the relative velocity , further discussed in se15 . \n that work additionally shows that , in principle , the multipole decomposition can clearly separate the effects of linear and non - linear bias  significant because ,

calibration of any 3pcf measurements against large cosmological simulations . \n such improved calibration should greatly enhance the leverage of the 3pcf as a fundamental probe of large - scale

Our results show that the presence of an external planetesimal disk can significantly affect the final eccentricity of extrasolar planets, especially for systems with giant planets that are captured into mean-motion resonances during the late stages of gas disk evolution.

planet scattering will play a dynamical role . \n a wide range of outcomes is then possible . \n exchange of energy and angular momentum between the planets and the planetesimal disk leads to planetary migration @xcite , which can be either stabilizing or destabilizing . \n a low mass planet adjacent to the disk scatters planetesimals inward , resulting in divergent migration that is often stabilizing unless resonance crossing excites eccentricity to the point of triggering instability . \n alternatively , an outer massive planet interacting with the disk directly ejects planetesimals and migrates inward , compressing the system and leading to instability or resonant capture . \n an equally important effect is that the disk can act to recircularize the orbits of scattered planets _ \n after _ dynamical instabilities @xcite . to illustrate how significant recircularization can be we ran a small additional set of idealized experiments \n in which a single planet with mass @xmath25 on an orbit with @xmath26 and @xmath27 begins to interact with our _ initial _ planetesimal disk . for @xmath28 years ( longer for smaller @xmath25 ) \n , @xmath29 is damped roughly exponentially with a damping time scale @xmath30 , defined via , @xmath31 of @xmath32 years , independent of @xmath25 . \n the subsequent evolution was highly mass -

mass systems or close encounters in low - mass systems  that are nonetheless insufficient to alter the architecture .  unstable \n \" systems undergo close encounters leading to architectural change . \n subsets of our runs show dynamics analogous to that studied for the solar system and for extra - solar planetary systems . at high masses planetesimal disks \n stabilize about 30% of cases but planet - planet scattering leading to the loss of one or more planets is still common . \n quantitatively , the median eccentricity is reduced ( figure  [ fig : ecum ] ) but many highly eccentric systems remain . \n as planet masses decreases the dynamical importance of planetesimals grows . for low - mass systems , \n the masses of the planets and the planetesimal disk are comparable and planetesimal scattering inevitably leads to migration . \n divergent crossing of mean - motion resonances ( one example of which is shown in the center panel of figure  [ fig : evol9 ] ) can result in abrupt changes to planetary semi - major axis and eccentricity that qualitatively resemble those seen in the nice model @xcite . \n we also see behavior that resembles an alternative solar system model in which uranus and neptune formed in the jupiter - saturn region and were scattered outward @xcite ( top left panel ) . at the lowest masses \n even highly unstable systems rarely destroy any planets because recircularization of scattered planets is efficient ( top center panel ) , though re - ordering of planets is common . in summary , \n dynamics characteristic of the outer solar system is common among low- to medium - mass planetary systems .    the main prediction of our model is the statistical distribution of planetary eccentricity as a function of planet mass . \n figure  [ fig : mtot - e ] shows the distribution of the eccentricity of the innermost surviving planet as a function of the total mass in surviving planets . in the absence of disks we observe similar behavior across all system masses \n the shift to smaller eccentricities for the lowmass runs , seen in figure  [ fig : ecum ] , is not visually apparent . \n when disks are included , the eccentricity distribution divides into two distinct regimes : a low mass regime in which planetesimal dynamics dominates to yield low eccentricities and a high mass planet scattering dominated regime where planetesimals play a minor role . \n for our specific parameters ( inner edge disk edge at 10  au , and a disk mass of 50  @xmath4 assumed to be typical for a stellar metallicity @xmath37 ) the transition between these regimes occurs for system masses @xmath38 . \n we predict that systems whose giant planets orbit between 5 and 10  au , and which have a total mass below 1  @xmath39 , will typically have low eccentricity orbits . \n this critical mass should scale roughly linearly with the stellar metallicity , as we expect the initial planetesimal disk mass to be proportional to @xmath40 . \n we expect the same qualitative behavior even if the zone of giant planet formation extends to larger radii @xcite , though in this case the low eccentricity regime would only be observable further out . \n although the eccentricity distribution of extrasolar planets is consistent with the hypothesis that _ all _ newly formed multiple systems are unstable in the absence of disks , this conclusion may also be biased by selection effects . \n most known extrasolar planets probably suffered significant gas disk migration prior to scattering @xcite , so the high incidence of instability may be a consequence of migration rather than formation . with this in mind we have separately analyzed those ( previously excluded ) systems that were stable in the absence of disks to see what impact disks have on them . \n as expected , low eccentricity outcomes predominate . \n resonances are also common : about 70% of all stable highmass simulations and 1/3 of stable lowmass simulations include at least one pair of planets in the 3:2 or , more often , the 2:1 mean motion resonance . \n this is a much higher probability of resonance capture than occurs for pure planet - planet scattering without disks @xcite , and it also exceeds the fraction of resonant systems that are expected to survive the gaseous disk phase in the presence of turbulence @xcite . \n most surprisingly within the highmass set a substantial fraction ( about 1/3 ) of stable systems become locked into mean - motion resonances that involve _ all three _ of the planets  analogs of the laplace resonance among jupiter s galilean satellites . chains of resonances . \n roughly half of the resonant systems were deep in the resonance , with @xmath41 . \n this fraction appears to be independent of the number of planets in resonance , as about 1/4 of the highmass resonant chains had @xmath41 for _ both _ pairs of planets . ] \n arise preferentially in higher - mass systems and in systems where planetesimal - driven migration causes compression rather than divergent migration . \n detection of high mass planets at the relevant radii ( between 5 - 10  au ) should soon be possible via astrometric or direct imaging techniques , and observation of resonant chains would be consistent with our model . \n intriguingly , the recently - discovered triple planet system hr 8799 may be in a 4:2:1 resonant chain @xcite . \n determining whether capture into resonance was initiated by a gas or planetesimal disk may be possible via detailed comparison of the outcome of resonant capture in planetesimal @xcite versus gas disks @xcite . \n circumstantial evidence suggests that many observed properties of the outer solar system @xcite and of extrasolar planetary systems @xcite may be attributable to the dynamical effects of planetesimal scattering and planet - planet scattering . here \n , we have studied the predicted architecture of planetary systems that results from the joint action of both mechanisms . \n we have argued that this regime will be relevant once lower mass extrasolar planets are discovered at larger orbital radii than those currently known . \n generically we predict that a transition to  solar - system - like \" architectures , characterized by near - circular orbits and relatively stable planetary separations , will be observed once surveys detect planets in the regime where planetesimal disks play a dynamical role . \n our simulations suggest that the transition is a surprisingly sharp function of total planetary system mass , and that it occurs for system masses a factor of several larger than the initial planetesimal disk mass . \n our initial conditions do not sample anything approaching the full range of initial planetary system architectures . \n we believe that the existence of a transition between typically eccentric and near - circular orbits is a general feature of joint models of planet - planet and planetesimal scattering , but the transition mass and minimum orbital radii at which planetesimal effects become manifest is of course a function of the poorly known masses and radial extent of planetesimal disks . \n our results suggest that the transition might be seen for sub - jovian mass planets at orbital radii of 5 - 10  au , but the transition would be pushed to greater orbital radii if giant planet formation consumes planetesimals across a wider extent of the disk . \n we also find that the final system architecture varies substantially depending on the initial separation of the planets . \n in particular , if planet formation yields a mixture of massive systems in initially stable orbits , interaction with planetesimals drives a large fraction of systems into resonance . \n whether such systems exist should be testable in the near future . \n we thank google for the large amount of computer time needed for these simulations . \n s.n.r . acknowledges support from nasa s astrobiology institute through the virtual planetary laboratory lead team , and from nasa s origins of solar systems program ( nnx09ab84 g ) . \n p.j.a . acknowledges support from the nsf ( ast-0807471 ) , from nasa s origins of solar systems program ( nnx09ab90 g ) , and from nasa s astrophysics theory program ( nnx07ah08 g ) .", "human_aspect": "{\n  \"background\": \"we study the final architecture of planetary systems that evolve under the combined effects of planet -

[ fig_heating_comp_sf](a ) . \n they show agreement at low and intermediate velocities @xmath2 , whereas they differ at large @xmath2 . \n this noticeable difference at large @xmath2 is due to the absence of global thermal equilibrium of the stirred gas . as explained in sec . \n [ sec_nonequilibrium ] , the stirred gas relaxes by transporting the excess energy between the superfluid in the central part and the thermal cloud in the periphery , which is a slow process . \n the absence of global thermal equilibrium leads to a smaller wing temperature than the equilibrium temperature . \n the results shown in fig . [ fig_heating_comp_sf](a ) indicate that the onset of heating occurs at a velocity @xmath1 , and for @xmath122 heating increases rapidly . both in experiment and simulation @xmath1 \n is determined using the fitting function in eq . \n [ fit ] . in fig . \n [ fig_heating_comp_sf](b ) we show the comparison between the experiment and simulation for stirring the thermal region of the trapped gas of @xmath123 atoms . \n the simulated density profile of the gas is given in the inset of fig . \n [ fig_heating_comp_sf](b ) . \n both the measured and simulated heating @xmath120 are in good agreement . \n the simulated @xmath121 determined from the equilibrium temperature of the system are below the measured @xmath120 at large @xmath2 . as we will explain in sec . \n [ sec_nonequilibrium ] , this is again due to the absence of global thermal equilibrium . as the stirred thermal cloud has more excess energy than the condensate , the wing temperature is larger than the equilibrium temperature . \n the results shown in fig . \n [ fig_heating_comp_sf](b ) indicate that heating occurs at all @xmath2 , which results in a zero @xmath1 . \n next , we show in fig . \n [ fig_heating_comp_sf](c ) the comparison between the experiment and simulation for @xmath1 that are determined by stirring the superfluid , the crossover , and the thermal regime . in the experiment @xcite @xmath1 \n is measured for different configurations of the total number of atoms @xmath124 , the temperatures @xmath42 , and the stirring radii @xmath60 . \n we compare the measured @xmath1 with the simulated @xmath1 determined by stirring the 2d gas in sec . \n [ sec_vc_sim ] . \n we show both the measured and simulated @xmath1 as a function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath125 . \n the parameter @xmath126 characterizes the degree of degeneracy of the cloud and is the relavant parameter in the sense that the thermodynamic properties of the gas depend only on the ratio @xmath127 @xcite . \n we refer to @xmath1 determined from the wing temperature @xmath118 and from the equilibrium temperature @xmath68 as @xmath128 and @xmath129 , respectively . \n both the measured and simulated @xmath128 show good agreement . \n the measured @xmath128 and the simulated @xmath129 agree in the superfluid and thermal regime , while they differ in the crossover regime . \n for the measured and simulated @xmath128 , the crossover regime occurs at @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively . \n however , for the simulated @xmath129 , it occurs at @xmath132 . \n the theoretical prediction for the bkt transition in a uniform gas @xcite with @xmath133 occurs at @xmath134 . \n this prediction is comparable to the simulated crossover regime identified by @xmath129 , whereas its comparison with the crossover regimes identified by the measured and simulated @xmath128 shows a shift . \n this shift was observed in ref . \n @xcite , but could not be explained . \n we conclude that the experiments of ref . \n @xcite can be reproduced quantitatively if the wing temperature is used , rather than @xmath68 . \n this suggests that the system has not relaxed to thermal equilibrium after the waiting time of @xmath115 . \n we confirm and elaborate on this point and the underlying mechanism in the following sections . \n we now investigate the relaxation of the system , following the stirring process in the superfluid regime . \n this includes a discussion of the influence of the confinement of the system in the @xmath23 direction . for strong confinement , \n the system approaches a purely 2d limit , while it is quasi-2d for intermediate confinement . \n we first analyze the energy - flow dynamics of a stirred trapped gas in the purely 2d limit , and then compare this dynamics with a quasi-2d gas . for a pure-2d trapped gas , \n we consider a gas of @xmath135 @xmath0rb atoms , which is strongly confined in the transverse direction by the harmonic potential . the temperature @xmath86 is smaller than the transverse trap energy @xmath136 , so that the gas is in the ground state in this direction . as the width of the condensate in the @xmath23 direction is smaller than the lattice discretization length @xmath53 \n , we simulate this system using a single @xmath137-layer of lattice only , see sec . \n [ sec_sim_method ] . \n we stir the gas at @xmath138 for @xmath139 at a velocity @xmath94 . \n after that we switch off the stirring potential and let the gas relax . \n we calculate the local energy @xmath140 of the stirred gas and its final equilibrated local energy @xmath141 , as described in sec . \n [ sec_sim_method ] . \n we show the evolution of the excess energy @xmath142 for various relaxation times @xmath143 in fig . [ \n fig_energyevolution](a ) . \n @xmath144 is the maximum density of the system . \n the evolution of @xmath145 after @xmath146 shows that most of the stirring - induced energy resides within the superfluid region . \n the system then relaxes by transporting this excess energy to the thermal cloud . \n this process occurs slowly and the system achieves fully equilibration only after about @xmath147 relaxation time , remarkably . \n we now study this energy - flow dynamics for the case of a quasi-2d gas . \n we consider the quasicondensate that we use in sec . \n [ sec_vc_sim ] . \n the initial temperature of the gas and the harmonic potential in the transverse direction are equal and half of those in the pure-2d case , respectively . \n the resulting system is a quasi-2d gas . \n we simulate this system using five @xmath137-layers of lattice in the @xmath23 direction . \n we stir the gas using the same stirring parameters as for the pure-2d case . \n we show the evolution of the excess energy @xmath145 of the stirred gas for various @xmath143 in fig . [ fig_energyevolution](b ) . in this case , @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath144 are the column ( i.e. integrated along the @xmath23 axis ) quantities . \n the evolution of @xmath145 after @xmath146 is similar to the pure-2d gas . \n again , the system relaxes by transporting the excess energy to the thermal cloud . \n the equilibration process is slightly slower than for the pure-2d gas but again of the same order of @xmath147 . \n we note that the measured relaxation times in ref . \n @xcite are indeed of the order of the relaxation times that we find here .    in the experiment @xcite the waiting time after stirring and before measurement is @xmath148 , which is shorter than the relaxation times that we observe here . \n this indicates that in the experiment thermal equilibrium between the superfluid and thermal cloud is not fully established , which influences the measured heating . \n it leads to respectively lower and higher measured heating for stirring the superfluid and thermal parts of the cloud .      to understand what causes this slow relaxation for the system \n , we now examine the evolution of the density and vortices of the system . \n we calculate the local density as @xmath74 and vortices as described in sec . \n [ sec_sim_method ] . \n we show the density and vortex evolution of a single realization of the stirred pure- and quasi-2d gas after various @xmath143 in fig . \n [ fig_vortexdynamics ] . for both systems , \n the density relaxation is hard to recognize , whereas the vortex evolution clearly exhibits decay of vortices . \n thus , the system relaxes via decay of the induced vortices . \n vortices can decay via both annihilation of a vortex with an antivortex , and drifting out to the thermal region of the cloud . \n for the pure-2d gas the number of vortices after @xmath146 is larger than the quasi-2d gas . \n @xcite reported that vortex annihilation in a pure-2d system is strongly suppressed as compared to a quasi-2d system because the vortex lines are impermeable to tilting @xcite and bending @xcite . \n so , the suppression of vortex annihilation can be a reason for the long - lived vortices for the pure-2d gas .     as a function of time @xmath38 for the pure- and quasi-2d gas . \n we fit the vortex decay with the bi - exponential function in eq . \n [ eq_fit_decay ] and determine the decay times @xmath149 ( see text ) . \n the fitted curves are shown as the dashed lines . ]    to make a quantitative comparison for the vortex relaxation between the two system , we count the total number of vortices within the superfluid region of the cloud at a detection radius @xmath150 , and average it over @xmath151 realizations . \n we show the averaged vortex number @xmath152 as a function of time @xmath38 for both systems in fig . \n [ fig_vortexdecay ] . as stirring \n is switched on at time @xmath153 , @xmath152 starts to increase approximately linearly . \n it reaches its maximum @xmath154 at @xmath155 . \n after the stirring is switched off , it decays approximately exponentially . for both systems \n the nature of vortex growth and decay are the same , but the rates with which they grow and decay are different . for the pure-2d gas the growth and decay rates are larger and smaller than those for the quasi-2d gas , respectively . the enhanced growth and the suppressed decay rate for the pure-2d gas can be due to the suppression of vortex annihilation , as mentioned above , and a slow vortex drift . \n we quantify the vortex decay rate using the function , @xmath156 with the free parameters @xmath157 . from the fit \n , we determine @xmath158 and @xmath159 for pure- and quasi-2d gas , respectively . \n these decay times are similar to those determined from the mean excess energy in appendix [ app_energy_flow ] . \n the fast decay @xmath160 and the slow decay @xmath161 are essentially connected to the vortex annihilation and drift lifetime , respectively . for the pure-2d gas @xmath160 and @xmath161 \n are larger than and equal to those for the quasi-2d gas , respectively . \n we show in table [ tab : rdet ] @xmath154 and the extracted @xmath149 at varying @xmath162 , for both systems . @xmath160 and @xmath161 increase weakly as @xmath162 is increased \n . however , the following conclusions are essentially independent of the choice of @xmath162 . \n overall , @xmath154 and @xmath160 are larger for pure-2d gas than those for quasi-2d gas , respectively , while @xmath161 are similar for both systems . \n we compare the simulated @xmath149 of quasi-2d gas to the waiting time of @xmath148 in the experiment @xcite . \n this time is twice as large as the fast decay @xmath160 , whereas it is smaller than the slow decay @xmath161 . \n this suggests that most vortex recombination processes have occurred at the time of the measurement . \n however , the vortex drift to the thermal cloud has not occurred , and the system is in a metastable state , not in the equilibrated state . \n this is the mechanism that is responsible for the difference between the wing temperature and the equilibrium temperature . \n we note that in ref . \n @xcite an estimate for the time of a vortex line drifting to the thermal cloud was given . while this estimate was for a three dimensional system , we find that the analytical estimate of ref . \n @xcite gives a timescale that is consistent with our simulation . \n we also note that the vortex lifetime is suppressed at high tempearures @xcite .      in this section \n we elaborate on the relaxation dynamics of the stirred trapped gas that we discuss in sec . \n [ sec_nonequilibrium ] . \n we first discuss the energy flow dynamics in sec . \n [ app_energy_flow ] and then the vortex dynamics in sec . \n [ app_vortex_dynamics ] .      here \n we elaborate on the energy flow dynamics for the pure- and quasi-2d trapped system . \n we stir both systems with the stirring potential at velocity @xmath177 . after stirring we \n calculate the excess energy @xmath142 as described in sec . \n [ sec_nonequilibrium ] and by averaging this energy over the superfluid region of the gas , we calculate the mean energy @xmath181 . \n we show the evolution of @xmath181 for both systems in fig . \n [ fig_app_energy_decay](a ) . \n @xmath181 decays approximately exponentially as the excess energy @xmath145 within the superfluid region outflows to the thermal cloud . \n we quantify the energy decay time using the fitting function in eq . \n [ eq_fit_decay ] . from the fit \n , we determine the decay times @xmath182 and @xmath183 for pure- and quasi-2d gas , respectively . \n these decay times are similar to the ones that we determine from the vortex decay in sec . \n [ sec_vortex ] . \n in addition to the stirring at @xmath177 , we show @xmath181 corresponding to stirring at @xmath184 for the pure- and quasi-2d gas in fig .

delay due to the line - of - sight path - length difference between the two lobes of the inclined nebula . \n the linearly - polarized - flux - only images , @xmath19 , were constructed with the stokes _ q _ and _ u _ images ( @xmath20 ; figs . \n [ figimages]c , d ) . in the single - scattering limit , \n @xmath19 images represent the cross - sections of the circumstellar shell because @xmath19 tends to be the strongest when the angle of scattering is close to @xmath21 . \n this uniqueness of @xmath19 had been used previously to probe the dust density structure in the evolve star circumstellar shells @xcite . \n contrary to our expectations , however , the bipolar lobes and searchlight beams appeared more prominently than the concentric arcs ( figs . \n [ figimages]c , d ) . \n this indicates that the nebula can not be approximated in the single - scattering limit ( as evidenced by the presence of the dust lane ) : the is therefore illuminated by a two - step process , in which starlight is first directed into the lobes and then scattered off from the lobes to the rest of the nebula . \n the polarization strength images , @xmath22 , display the relative strength of polarization more clearly ( figs . \n [ figimages]e , f ) . while stronger polarizations ( @xmath23 ) are seen in the lobes and searchlight beams , weaker polarizations ( @xmath24 ) \n are dominant along the equatorial plane except for the region of medium polarizations ( about 30 to @xmath25 , delineating the central @xmath26 region around the dust lane ( @xmath27 by @xmath28 au at 420 pc ) . \n this medium - polarization region appears to represent the surface of a marginal central dust concentration ( often referred to as a dust cocoon ; @xcite ) at which the line - of - sight optical depth at @xmath29 becomes greater than unity ( i.e. , dustsphere as in photosphere and molsphere ) . \n this dustsphere and the bipolar lobes are essentially brightly - lit surfaces that illuminate the rest of the nebula . \n hence , dust - scattered light from the rest of the nebula tends to be de - polarized , i.e. , weak in @xmath19 and @xmath30 . \n the structure of this central dust concentration is still unknown . \n @xcite reported the presence of a hollow co shell of @xmath31 radius expanding at @xmath32  km  s@xmath2 at the position angle of @xmath33 ( coincident with the orientation of the 1.3 mm dust continuum ) . \n thus , this medium - polarization - strength region could represent the `` near - side surface '' of this central expanding co / dust shell . to better assess the geometry of the central material distribution , further investigations at higher spatial resolution at optically - thin bands are required .      the polarization angle ( _ pa _ \n @xmath34 ) images show the position angle of the electric vector of the incident light ( figs . \n [ figimages]g , h ) . \n images for optically - thin nebulae typically show a pattern of an azimuthal gradient , which represents continuously changing polarization vector angles with respect to the position of the illumination source . \n however , our maps reveal roughly the same angle near the center generally aligned with the dust lane ( @xmath35 of e of n ) , indicating higher dust density around the dust lane at which the single - scattering approximation breaks down . for this reason \n , we were unable to pinpoint the location of the illumination source by back - tracing the polarization vectors ( e.g. , @xcite ) more accurately than a one-@xmath13 error ellipse of @xmath36 . \n as discussed above , the optical reflection nebulosity of the is caused by a two - step illumination process in rather de - polarized light . \n therefore , we reverted to the total intensity @xmath37 maps ( i.e. , to utilise all the flux available to us ) to follow the differential proper - motion of local shell structures using the same correlational method as in our previous analysis . \n briefly , this method measures the amount of translational shift of a given structure between two epochs via a cross - correlation analysis between cutouts of the two - epoch images ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n we use our own idl script set created as part of our previous proper - motion investigations of the in the near - ir ( @xcite for details ) .    to make the analysis more tractable with the @xmath37 maps , we edge - enhanced the shell structure while minimizing the background noise by processing the maps with the roberts cross operator @xcite . \n these maps are shown in fig . \n [ figroberts ] . because concentric arcs are azimuthally symmetric \n , the present correlational method is unable to break the azimuthal degeneracy and uniquely trace translational shifts of arc segments along the azimuthal direction . \n this prevented us from following the differential proper - motion of structures azimuthally away from the bipolar axis , and hence , from independently confirming the bulk motion of the nebula and location of the expansion center . \n thus , for the present analysis we adopted the previously discovered ( 1 ) bulk motion of the at a rate of ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) mas yr@xmath2 , ( 2 ) the location of the illumination source / expansion center , and ( 3 ) the distance to the at @xmath5  pc as found in our previous analysis @xcite . \n we then selected 30 distinct local structures that register more than five s / n with respect to the sky background distributed in the lobes ( 13 structures ) and searchlight beams radially beyond the lobes ( 17 structures ) and performed the correlational analysis to measure proper motion of these structures . to disregard the inadvertent azimuthal shifts \n , we extracted only the projected radial component of the expansion of the structures as presented in fig . \n [ figvectors]a . \n the same data are displayed as a plot of the projected radial component of the differential proper - motion vector ( @xmath38 in mas  yr@xmath2 and km  s@xmath2 ) vs.  projected radial distance from the location of the illumination source / expansion center ( @xmath39 in arcsec ) in fig . \n [ figvectors]b . for each of the lobes and arc segments , \n linear fitting was done to characterize its proper motion . upon fitting , we consider the following three plausible cases : ( 1 ) a linear expansion ( linear fitting of @xmath38 vs.  @xmath39 anchored at the origin ) , ( 2 ) a constant - speed expansion ( fitting by a horizontal line ) , and ( 3 ) a more general linear expansion ( linear fitting with a non - zero intercept ) , and compared their bayesian and akaike information criteria ( bic and aic ) to identify the best - fit . uncertainties in the projected speed and distances are roughly 5.0  mas  yr@xmath2 and 2@xmath40 , respectively . \n however , the _ relative _ spacing among individual structures within an ensemble remains the same and hence the slope of the linear fitting is robust . \n the best - fit for the lobes yielded @xmath41  mas  yr@xmath2 or @xmath42  km  s@xmath2 ( the solid white line in the dark - gray zone ) , indicating that the lobes are expanding linearly with the dynamical age of @xmath43  yr , which is roughly consistent with the previous results , @xmath44 and @xmath45  yr ( @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) . \n @xcite measured the line of sight velocity of the tips of the co bipolar lobes ( coinciding with the optical lobe tip pair f1/f2 in their figs .  2 and 3 ) as @xmath46  km  s@xmath2 at @xmath47 away from the center . \n by adopting the projected radial expansion velocity of @xmath48  km  s@xmath2 at the tip of the n lobe , the inclination of the bipolar tips is computed as @xmath49 and the deprojected bipolar outflow velocity as @xmath50  km  s@xmath2 . \n this outflow velocity is consistent with the medium - velocity component found in co @xcite . \n the best - fit for the arc segments along the searchlight beams beyond the lobes turned out to be a constant - speed expansion at @xmath51  mas  yr@xmath2 or @xmath52  km  s@xmath2 ( the solid black line in the light - gray zone ) , suggesting that the arcs have been ejected in an on - going basis and coasting away at a constant speed , as opposed to being formed altogether at the same time and expanding linearly . \n this is a new finding from the present analysis with a larger field of view with respect to the previous analysis by @xcite , in which both growth patterns were found equally likely . \n a detection of the central co shell of @xmath31 radius expanding at around 10  km  s@xmath2 reported by @xcite , therefore , may be related to the presence of these concentric arcs . \n if so , the generation of the concentric arcs appears to have been continuing even after the onset of the bipolar lobe expansion .      to further alleviate the azimuthal degeneracy issue of the concentric arcs , we `` unrolled '' the edge - enhanced @xmath37 maps with respect to the adopted location of the expansion center to make polar ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) maps , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the radial distance from the center and the position angle measured from n , respectively \n then , we traced the projected radial motion of concentric arcs as a function of the position angle by performing the same correlational analysis only along the radial direction for each @xmath55 azimuthal arc segment as long as these arc segments register more than three-@xmath13 of the background ( fig . \n [ figunrolled]a , b ) .    fig . \n [ figunrolled]c shows the distribution of the projected radial velocities of these 1@xmath56 segments measured along 12 most prominent arcs . while uncertainties are relatively large owing to a large s / n discrepancy between the two - epoch maps , the present data suggest that the projected radial velocities tend to ( 1 ) converge to a minimum of about 10  km  s@xmath2 toward the regions of the searchlight beams / bipolar axis , and ( 2 ) increase by a factor of about a few as moving toward the equatorial plane . \n while the scatterer in the measured radial velocities is large , the increasing tendency appears genuine .    if there were a well - defined azimuthal / latitudinal gradient in the radial expansion velocity field , it should have manifested itself in the overall structure of the concentric arcs \n the arcs should have been elongated along the equatorial plane at least by a factor of a few \n . however , the arcs strikingly concentric . \n therefore , it is most likely that there is a faster outflow ( @xmath57  km  s@xmath2 ) in spatially restricted regions along the equatorial plane and that arc segments along the equatorial plane must have been blown out by such an outflow  the higher - velocity segments near the end of the observed arcs are most likely the arc edges being torn off by the suspected outflow . \n combined altogether , it appears that there are three distinct outflow components in the circumstellar environs of the . \n there is a generally spherically symmetric steady outflow with a periodical modulation at about 10  km  s@xmath2 , which is responsible for the concentric arcs . \n based on the arc segments seen farthest from the center in the higher - s / n epoch 2 map , this periodic outflow appears to have continued at least for the past @xmath3  yr at the interval of @xmath58  yr at 420  pc . \n this generally symmetric shell structure seems to be disrupted by two distinct outflow components , one along the bipolar axis and the other along the equatorial plane . \n it has already been shown that the bipolar lobes have been being excavated by a linear expansion for the past @xmath59  yr with the tip velocity being about 30  km  s@xmath2 . \n circumstantially , this linearly expanding outflow along the polar axis seems to have punched holes out of the central dust cocoon , through which most of the dust - scattered light streams out along the bipolar axis to illuminate the lobes . \n the present analysis of the concentric arcs has indicated the presence of another outflow component along the equatorial plane : its velocity appears to be greater than @xmath60  km  s@xmath2 based on the ways that concentric arcs are being disrupted along the equatorial plane . \n other observational details of this outflow including the mode and duration , however , remain unclear . \n the apparent superposition of three outflow components in the is dynamically very intriguing . \n while theoretical consideration of the latitudinal dependence of the _ velocity _ field has been rare ( e.g. , @xcite ) , in studying the influence of the central binary system to the agb wind structure , @xcite numerically discovered that ( 1 ) the latitudinal dependence of the gas density is always accompanied by a latitudinal decline in the outflow velocity field , and ( 2 ) there can be a positive correlation between the latitudinal density and velocity contrasts ( i.e. , outflow velocity becomes faster where density is greater ; their model 4 ) , contrary to many dust - driven models that _ assume _ a velocity profile that increases toward the polar direction . \n this means that the present case may provide rare observational evidence for such a colatitudinally - dependent outflow velocity field resulting from the egg - beater mass - loss modulation by the central binary system . while spiral modulation of mass - loss ejecta due to the central binary system has been seen around agb stars for near pole - on cases ( afgl 3068 ; @xcite , mira ; @xcite , r scl ; @xcite ) , the present data may lend support for an edge - on case in which ( 1 ) the spiraling trails of mass - loss ejecta appear as concentric arcs , and ( 2 ) the colatitudinal velocity field promotes an equatorial outflow fast enough to disrupt the ejecta ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    one issue in the present analysis \n is that the discrepancy in the signal strengths in the two - epoch data set ( due to much lesser s / n of epoch 1 data ) resulted in rather large uncertainties in proper - motion measurements . at any rate , both theoretical and observational work is scarce at best to establish the connection between the concentric arcs and the binary modulation of stellar winds \n therefore , another epoch of _ hst _ observations to obtain data with a comparable s / n to the epoch 2 data are extremely interesting in quantifying the colatitudinal dependence of the radial velocity field to be compared against the latest theoretical expectations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n also , mapping these concentric arcs in co at the comparable spatial resolution of the full _ alma _ is worthwhile ( e.g. , @xcite ) to do understand kinematics between the gas and dust components of these outflows . \n we performed differential proper - motion and radial - motion analyses on both the signature bipolar lobes and concentric arcs of the using two - epoch optical data taken by the _ hst_. \n our method , based on ( 1 ) aligning two - epoch images using stationary background stars as spatial anchors , and ( 2 ) measuring the amount translational movement of specific local structures by a correlational method , is more robust than the previous analysis by @xcite that assumed symmetry in the shell expansion . \n our findings are that ;    1 . \n the is illuminated optically by a two - step mechanism , in which the direct starlight is first channeled into the bipolar cavities and then scattered off to the rest of the nebula , 2 . \n there is a `` dustsphere '' around the central star ( @xmath27  au by @xmath28 au at 420  pc ) , most likely representing the surface of the central dust concentration at which the line - of - sight optical depth in the @xmath29 band becomes significantly larger than unity , 3 . \n the bipolar lobes expand linearly for the past @xmath43  yr , excavating into an otherwise symmetric concentric shells as found by the previous analyses @xcite , 4 . \n arc segments found along the searchlight beams beyond the bipolar lobes all move at similar projected radial velocity at @xmath52  km  s@xmath2 for the past @xmath3  yr , 5 . \n the projected radial expansion velocity field of the concentric arcs shows an increasing trending toward the equatorial plane by a factor of a few , representing torn - off edges of the arcs disrupted by a fast equatorial outflow at @xmath61  km  s@xmath2 , and 6 \n .   the present case may provide observational evidence for the binary modulation of stellar winds , as predicted by @xcite , which generates the colatitudinal dependence in the radial expansion velocity field and the spiral -

dimensional counterparts ( optical vortices ) . \n for the first time , dss in @xmath1 models were considered in the cascading limit , which corresponds to a large phase mismatch between the fundamental - frequency ( ff ) and second - harmonic ( sh ) waves @xcite . in this limit \n , the @xmath1 model reduces to the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation with the kerr [ @xmath4 nonlinearity . beyond the cascading limit , a single analytical solution @xcite , and a continuous family of numerical solutions for fundamental and twin - hole dss @xcite were found . \n all these solitons are unstable in the spatial domain , due to the modulational instability ( mi ) of the cw ( continuous - wave ) plane - wave background which supports the ds . \n the only possibility to avoid the mi was found in the temporal domain , in the case when the group - velocity - dispersion coefficients have opposite signs at the ff and sh @xcite ( in fact , such a case is quite realistic in the temporal domain @xcite ) . \n nevertheless , effectively stable spatial - domain vortices , supported by a background of finite extension , were experimentally created in the case of negative phase mismatch between the ff and sh waves @xcite . in the latter case , \n the mi had the character of a convective instability , so that perturbations were carried away from the vortex s core faster than they grew due to the mi . \n additional possibilities for creation of solitons are offered by a combination of @xmath1 nonlinearity with bragg gratings ( bgs ) . \n the grating may be introduced in both the time - domain and spatial - domain models , but in the latter one it is a more realistic feature , amounting to a system of parallel scratches  drawn on the surface of a quadratically nonlinear planar waveguide . in that case , the generic @xmath1 model is a four - wave one , as both the ff and sh components include two counter - propagating waves ( detailed descriptions of the model can be found in the reviews @xcite and @xcite ) . \n the mi of cw solutions was studied in the four - wave model , with a conclusion that they are unstable in most cases . \n stability regions for the cw states were also found , close to the transition to the nls limit , but only in a rather exotic case when the bg strength at the sh is larger than at the ff @xcite . \n a stable dark bi - soliton in this model was found numerically near the band edge @xcite .    in this paper , \n our aim is to investigate the mi of cw states , and , in the case when they are stable , to find dss in a _ three - wave _  spatial - domain system , in which two ff components are linearly coupled through the resonant scattering on the bg . \n simultaneously , the quadratic nonlinearity couples the two ff components to the sh wave . the propagation direction @xmath5 is parallel to the scratches \" which form the bg \n . then , the above - mentioned couplings can be achieved by choosing ff carrier wave vectors to be of equal magnitude and making opposite angles with the @xmath5 axis , while the sh wave vector is parallel to it . \n thus , only the ff components are affected by the grating , while the sh wave is subject to diffraction . \n this model was introduced in ref . \n @xcite in the context of bright solitons . \n stable gap solitons , as well as bright _ embedded solitons _ ( which exist inside the continuous part of the system s linear spectrum @xcite ) have been found in this three - wave model . \n the paper is structured as follows . \n the model is formulated in section [ sec : model ] , where we also give an estimate for relevant values of the physical parameters . in section [ mi ] , we identify two types of cw solutions and analyze their modulational stability . \n it is shown that , on the contrary to other @xmath1 models in the spatial domain , in the present case one type of the cw solutions is _ stable _ in a broad range of parameters . \n dss supported by the stable cw background are considered in section [ dark ] . for stationary fundamental solitons , \n we find an approximate analytical and direct numerical solutions . \n _ tilted solitons _ ( with a slant relative to the propagation axis @xmath5 ) , as well as bound states of two dss , are found too . \n section [ stability ] presents results for the stability and interactions of the dss . \n it is shown that both the fundamental solitons and their bound states are _ stable _ in the whole region where the respective cw is modulationally stable . \n the work is concluded by section [ conclusions ] . \n we consider a quadratically nonlinear planar waveguide with a spatial bg in the form of scores directed parallel to the propagation direction @xmath5 . as shown in ref . \n @xcite , spatial evolution of two components @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the complex ff field , and the complex sh field @xmath8 obey the following system of normalized equations : @xmath9 here @xmath5 and @xmath10 are , respectively , the propagation and transverse coordinates , the subscripts stand for partial derivatives , the asterisk means for the complex conjugation , @xmath11 is the phase - mismatch parameter , and @xmath12 is an effective diffraction coefficient , defined with regard to the fact that bragg - reflectivity and @xmath1 constants are normalized to be @xmath13 . \n we notice that the complex conjugation applied to eqs . \n ( [ evolution ] ) , and the change of the notation @xmath14 , @xmath15 transforms @xmath12 to @xmath16 , therefore we may assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath12 is always positive ( while @xmath11 may be positive , negative , or zero ) . \n stationary solitary - wave solutions are looked for as @xmath17 where real @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the propagation constant and tilt of the corresponding optical beam in the @xmath20 plane , and complex functions @xmath21 are to be found from the equations @xmath22 with @xmath23 and the prime standing for @xmath24 . for symmetric ( untilted ) solutions with @xmath25 , one may set @xmath26 , @xmath27 , where the function @xmath28 is real , which yields a simplified system , @xmath29    in physical units , the same value of the power density of the cw background in the linbo@xmath30 planar waveguide that was used in the experiments with bright spatial solitons @xcite , i.e. , @xmath31 w/@xmath32 m at the pump wavelength @xmath33 @xmath34 m , may be assumed , in combination with the bg reflectivity @xmath35 @xmath36 , which is a typical value for weak gratings . \n then , the physical value of the wavenumber detuning corresponding to @xmath37 , i.e. , just above the upper edge of the spectral gap , which is shown below to be appropriate for dss , is about @xmath38 @xmath36 . \n the range of the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath12 relevant to the experiment can be determined as in ref . \n @xcite , where the normalized parameters of the model were related to physical ones . in particular , @xmath39 may take values in a wide range , @xmath40 . \n for example , the large phase mismatch used for the experimental generation of vortices in a @xmath1 media in ref . \n @xcite corresponds to @xmath41 . \n realistic values of the effective sh diffraction parameter are @xmath42 , depending on the angle between the ff wave vectors and the @xmath5 axis . \n the angle must be , however , small enough for the applicability of the paraxial approximation , which is implied in eqs . \n ( [ evolution ] ) . \n equations ( [ model ] ) give rise to two types of cw solutions . \n the first of them is a real one , with in - phase ff and sh components , @xmath43 which exists provided that @xmath44 . \n below , it will be referred to as a pr ( _ pure - real _ ) solution . in the other solution , \n the phase of the ff component is shifted by @xmath2 against the sh , @xmath45 this solution , with a _ purely imaginary _ \n ff field , will be accordingly called a pi one ( of course , the sh is real in it ) . \n the pi solution exists provided that @xmath46 .    to investigate the modulational stability of the solutions , we consider a perturbed one in the form of    @xmath47\\exp ( ikz ) , \\\\ \n u_{2}=[u_{2}^{(0)}+a_{2}^{(0)}\\exp ( -i\\lambda z+i\\omega x)+b_{2}^{(0)}\\exp ( i\\lambda ^{\\ast } z -

( \n [ cubic ] ) are    @xmath56    for the cw solution of the pr type . for the pi - type solution , they are    @xmath57    equation ( [ cubic ] ) was solved numerically ( an analytical solution is formally available , but it takes an intractably complex form ) . the result , in the form of the stability region of the pi solution , is displayed in fig . \n notice that the solution is always unstable if its wavenumber belongs to the gap of the ff subsystem , which is @xmath58 . \n the cw solutions of the pr - type solutions are always modulationally unstable . \n however , for large values of @xmath59 ( actually , in the case of large phase mismatch ) , the instability band of the perturbation wavenumber @xmath51 becomes very narrow . \n for example , it is @xmath60 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 . \n therefore , the instability generated by a random perturbation will grow very slowly in that case , and , for practical purposes , the cw state may be regarded stable . \n the above results pertain to @xmath55 in eqs . \n ( [ evolution ] ) . with other values of @xmath12 \n , we have found that , for the pi - type cws , the increase of @xmath12 results in shrinkage of the stability area , and the decrease of @xmath12 results in its expansion , see the dotted and dashed curves in fig . \n the pr - type cw solution remains unstable at any @xmath12 . \n the availability of the modulationally - stable cw background suggests a possibility of existence of stable dss . as concerns search for stationary symmetric ( @xmath25 ) solutions , it is obvious that eqs . \n ( [ model ] ) are invariant with respect to the transformation @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , which makes it possible to set @xmath55 , varying only @xmath39 in the stationary equations . \n further , we substitute @xmath67 , which yields equations for the real functions @xmath68 and @xmath69 , @xmath70    the sh component can be sought for as @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the cw solution ( [ cw - two - wave - imag ] ) of the pi - type . \n then , for the solutions supported by the pi - type cw background , we obtain , from eqs . \n ( [ model_real ] ) , @xmath73 assuming , for the time being , @xmath74 , we approximate the second equation in ( [ model_real_pi_2 ] ) by @xmath75 ( the validity of this assumption will be considered later ) . then , we look for a fundamental ds solution in the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath72 are the same as in eqs . \n ( [ cw - two - wave - imag ] ) ( hence the solution is matched to the cw background at @xmath78 ) , while the constants @xmath79 and @xmath80 are to be found . note that , according to fig . \n [ mi ] , @xmath81 is negative in the region of stability of the cw background , hence the expression ( [ ansatz ] ) with @xmath82 assumes that @xmath83 has a minimum at @xmath84 . \n substitution of the _ ansatz _ ( [ ansatz ] ) into eqs . \n ( [ model_real_pi_2 ] ) and ( [ model_real_pi_3 ] ) shows that it solves the first two equations , but not the last one . to identify an approximate solution \n , we then demand the latter equations to be satisfied only at the central point , @xmath84 . \n this approach leads to a system of algebraic equations , which can be readily solved to yield the following results : @xmath85 @xmath86 provided that @xmath87 and @xmath88 . \n it is straightforward to check that the latter conditions are satisfied in the region of interest ( @xmath89 ) , where the cw solutions of the pi - type are modulationally stable , see fig . \n [ mi ] . \n the above approximation assumed @xmath90 . to examine the validity of this assumption , we note that the expression ( [ approx_solution_pi_1 ] ) , considered as a function of @xmath39 , attains the maximum value @xmath91 at @xmath92 , hence the assumption is formally justified for small @xmath93 ( near the upper edge of the spectral gap ) if @xmath39 ( i.e. , the phase mismatch ) is large , and for larger @xmath93 if @xmath39 is smaller .    according to eqs . \n ( [ ansatz ] ) , the parameters @xmath94 and @xmath95 determine the inverse ds contrasts @xmath96 , which may be defined as ratios of the amplitudes at the soliton s center to those in the cw background : @xmath97 and @xmath98 for the ff and sh , respectively . \n these parameters belong to the interval @xmath99 , the limiting cases of @xmath100 and @xmath101 corresponding , respectively , to the black soliton , and to the unmodulated cw solution . \n in particular , eqs . \n ( [ approx_solution_pi_1 ] ) and ( [ approx_solution_pi_2 ] ) predict the black soliton at @xmath102 . \n the dependences of the inverse contrast on @xmath39 , as obtained from the above approximation and from a direct numerical solution , are shown in fig . \n [ brightness_coeffs ] ( two cases shown in this figure adequately represent the general situation ) . \n the results demonstrate that the analytical approximation is , generally , quite accurate , although numerically found solitons are never completely black . with the increase of @xmath18 , \n the ff component becomes  grayer \" , while the sh one gets darker . \n typical examples of the direct comparison between the ds shape , as predicted by the analytical approximation , and as generated by the numerical solution , are displayed in fig . \n [ fundamental_dark ] . for @xmath103 and @xmath104 , \n the approximation is so close to the exact solution that they are indistinguishable . for @xmath105 and @xmath106 , \n the accuracy deteriorates , but the agreement is still fairly good . \n further numerical search for ds solutions supported by the modulationally stable cw background has revealed the existence of bound states of the dss , whose shape is similar to that of unstable bound states which were reported refs . @xcite and @xcite ( however , the bound states may be _ stable _ in the present model , see below ) . \n typical examples of twin - hole and tri - hole ds complexes are shown in figs . \n [ twin_dark ] and [ tripple_dark ] . \n the general ansatz ( [ general ] ) for steady - shape solutions admits tilted dss with @xmath107 . \n we have found such solitons by numerical search in the @xmath108 plane . \n the above - mentioned scaling , which allowed us to impose the normalization @xmath109 for the @xmath25 solitons , does not hold for the tilted ones . \n nevertheless , we set @xmath55 in this case too , as the additional problem of scanning the parameter space augmented by the effective diffraction coefficient @xmath12 is too complex .    for the tilted dss , the amplitudes of the two ff components @xmath6 and @xmath7 are no longer equal , and \n the sh field @xmath8 is not real ; accordingly , one should use eqs . \n ( [ moving_model ] ) instead of eqs . \n ( [ model ] ) . numerical solution for the tilted ( moving ) solitons gives rise to the dependence of the inverse contrasts in the three components ( forward  and backward  ff ones , and the sh component ) , defined as above , on the slope ( tilt ) @xmath19 . \n a typical result is shown in fig . \n [ moving_sigma ] . for the forward ( backward ) slope of the ds , \n the contrast of the forward ( backward ) ff component initially increases and attains a maximum at some tilt @xmath110 . for @xmath111 , \n the contrasts of both ff components decrease until the ds reaches a point @xmath112 where @xmath113 becomes equal to @xmath13 , i.e. , the ds disappears , bifurcating back into the cw solution . for the forward - tilted soliton , \n the forward ff component  of the soliton is always darker than its backward counterpart . \n the dependence of parameters of the tilted ds on @xmath39 , i.e. , on the phase mismatch , is shown in fig . \n [ sigma_of_alpha ] . as is seen , \n the slope @xmath110 , at which the maximum contrast of ff occurs , is virtually independent of @xmath39 . \n however , the slope @xmath114 at which the tilted ds bifurcates back into the cw , i.e. , the maximum slope past which the ds does not exist , increases with @xmath39 .    the dependence of the same parameters on @xmath18 , i.e. , as a matter of fact , on the detuning from the gap \n , is displayed in fig . \n [ sigma_of_k ] . \n as well as it was with the @xmath39-dependence , the largest ff contrast is independent of @xmath18 , but the corresponding @xmath110 grows with @xmath18 . \n the bifurcation value @xmath114 of the tilt is also a growing function of @xmath18 . \n it was observed too that the maximum values of the contrast remain themselves constant with the variation of both @xmath39 and @xmath18 .    as @xmath18 becomes still larger than in the cases like that shown in fig . \n [ sigma_of_k ] , viz . \n , at @xmath115 , the behavior of the ds solution changes drastically . in this region , \n the numerical scheme ceases to converge close to the bifurcation point , therefore the bifurcation ( merger of the ds back into the cw ) can not be identified . \n a typical example of the dependence of the ds contrast on the tilt for this situation is shown in fig . \n [ moving_sigma_large_k ] ( cf . \n [ moving_sigma ] ) . in this case , the numerical method does not converge for @xmath116 .    the normalized slope @xmath19 relates to its physical counterpart @xmath117 , which is the ratio of the real coordinates , as @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the angle between the ff wave vector and the axis @xmath5 . since the @xmath119 should be small for eqs . \n ( [ evolution ] ) to remain valid , the physical slopes expected to be observed in the experiment are on the order of @xmath120 . \n the stability of the cw background is only a necessary , but not sufficient condition for the stability of dss . \n we investigated their full stability by direct simulations , and also through a numerical solution of the eigenvalue problem for small perturbations . in the latter case , \n the perturbed solution was taken as @xmath121 \\exp ( ikz ) , \\\\ \n u_{2}(x , z ) & = & \\left [ u_{2}^{(0)}(x;k)+\\epsilon _ { 2}(x)\\exp ( i\\lambda z ) \\right ] \\exp ( ikz ) , \\\\ u_{3}(x , z ) & = & \\left [ u_{3}^{(0)}(x;k)+\\epsilon _ { 3}(x)\\exp ( i\\lambda z ) \\right ] \\exp ( 2ikz ) , \\end{array } \\label{perturbation_form}\\ ] ] where @xmath122represent an unperturbed ds solution , @xmath123 are eigenmodes of infinitesimal perturbations , and @xmath124 is the corresponding eigenvalue , the stability requiring all @xmath124 to be real . \n the expressions ( [ perturbation_form ] ) were substituted into eqs . \n ( [ evolution ] ) , and the resulting equations were linearized in @xmath123 . \n the problem significantly simplifies for the symmetric solitons with @xmath25 , when @xmath125 , and @xmath126 is real . in that case \n , we were able to find the full spectrum of the eigenvalues for both the fundamental dss and their twin - hole bound states ( see fig . \n [ twin_dark ] ) , on a sufficiently dense grid of points in ( @xmath39,@xmath18 ) plane . as in the previous sections , \n the analysis was restricted to the case of @xmath55 , as scanning through the full three - dimensional parametric space including @xmath12 is a very complex technical problem . as a result , it has been concluded that _ both _ the fundamental and twin - hole dss are _ always stable _ , provided that their cw background of the pi type is modulationally stable . \n the stability of the symmetric dss was also verified in direct simulations of eqs . \n ( [ evolution ] ) . \n the verification has shown that they are stable indeed , as predicted by the calculation of the perturbation eigenvalues . \n computation of the stability eigenvalues for the tilted fundamental dss is too hard to run it in a systematic form . \n however , their stability can be easily tested in direct simulations . \n the simulations reveal that , as well as their symmetric ( untilted ) counterparts , the tilted solitons are _ always stable _ if the cw background is stable . \n the stability of the dss with @xmath107 suggests a possibility to consider collisions  between them ( in fact , intersection between two spatial solitons tilted in opposite directions ) . \n the collisions were simulated too , with a conclusion that they always look completely elastic : the dss re - emerge unaffected after the collision , apart from a displacement of their centers , see an example in fig . \n [ collision ] . \n the character of the interaction remains the same for all values of @xmath39 and @xmath18 ( at least , for the slopes @xmath127 ) . \n the collision - induced shift of the centers is ( quite naturally ) slightly larger for smaller slopes . a typical x - junction formed by the intersection of two dark solitons \n is shown in fig . \n [ collision_contour ] . \n the collisions are , actually , quite similar to those observed in the integrable nls model describing dark solitons in a defocusing kerr medium . \n as the solitons collide , they repel each other , which is obvious from the contour - plot rendition in fig . \n [ collision_contour ] . \n it is relevant to note that interactions between dss in the integrable self - defocusing nls equation are repulsive too ( see , e.g. , ref . \n @xcite ) . \n we also simulated a different type of interactions between the ds , when two solitons with @xmath25 are originally placed at some distance ; obviously , this situation may be relevant to the experiment , and to possible applications . \n it has been observed that the solitons repel each other in this case as well . with very small radiation loss , \n they start to move  ( i.e. , acquire a finite slope ) , as is shown in fig . \n [ interaction ] . \n the eventual slope observed in this set of the simulations virtually does not depend on @xmath18 , and slightly increases with @xmath39 . \n in this work , we have considered uniform cw states and dark soliton ( dss ) in the system of three waves in a planar waveguide [ with two fundamental - frequency ( ff ) and one second - harmonic ( sh ) components ] coupled by the @xmath1 interaction . \n the ff waves are also linearly coupled by reflections on the bragg grating . \n this model was earlier shown to generate a great variety of bright solitons . \n we have demonstrated that , on the contrary to the usual situation in spatial - domain @xmath1 models , in the present case cw states with the phase shift @xmath2 between the ff and sh waves are modulationally stable in a broad parameter region , provided that the cw wavenumber lies outside the system s spectral gap . \n stationary fundamental dss supported by the stable cws were found numerically , and also by means of an _ ad hoc _ analytical approximation , which produced results that agree well with numerical findings . \n bound states of two and three dss were found too . \n the fundamental dss , as well as dark bi - solitons , are stable in all the cases when the cw background is stable ; this was demonstrated by means of calculation of the corresponding stability eigenvalues , and verified in direct simulations . \n we have also studied tilted fundamental dss . \n it was found that they attain a maximum contrast at a finite value of the slope , that virtually does not depend on the @xmath1 phase mismatch ; at a maximum value of the slope ( which grows with the mismatch ) , the ds merges into a cw state . \n interactions between tilted solitons were systematically simulated too , with a conclusion that the interactions are repulsive and completely elastic . \n 99 etrich c , lederer f , malomed b a , peschel t and peschel u 2000 _ progr . \n opt . _ * 41 * 483      di trapani p , caironi d , valiulis g , dubietis a , danielius r and piskarskas a 1998 _ phys . \n lett . _ * 81 * 570 ; valiulis g , dubietis a , danielius r , caironi d , visconti a and di trapani p 1999 _ j. opt . soc . am . \n b _ * 16 * 722                                         of the tilted dark soliton , at which the maximum contrast of the soliton s ff component is achieved ( circles ) , and the slope @xmath114 , at which the dark soliton merges into the cw background ( squares ) , versus the effective mismatch @xmath131 , for @xmath103 . ]", "human_aspect": "{\n  \"background\": \"we consider continuous -

YSOs form in dense molecular clouds and undergo gravitational collapse, leading to the formation of a young stellar object (YSO) surrounded by a circumstellar disk. The disk causes infrared excess and can be distinguished from main-sequence stars using instruments like the Spitzer Space Telescope. As the disk clears, the YSO's infrared colors match those of main-sequence stars. The accretion disk does not reach down to the central star, and the inner edge of the gas disk is truncated by the stellar magnetic field. The inner radius of the optically thick dust in the disk is larger than the inner radius of the gas disk, and some of the mass in the circumstellar disk condenses into planets, while the rest is blown out by accretion-driven disk and stellar winds. The accretion process can happen via magnetically confined accretion funnels or magneto-hydrodynamical instability. YSOs can have cool spots caused by magnetic activity and hot spots marking the impact points of the accretion funnels onto the stellar surface. The accretion shock heats the accreted mass to X-ray emitting temperatures, and the hot spot signatures can vary due to changes in the mass accretion rate. The dynamical timescale that controls the accretion is the Keplerian period of the inner disk, and optical variability with amplitudes around 0.1 mag is often observed in Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs) on this timescale. Additionally, YSOs can vary on longer timescales due to changing circumstellar extinction or massive accretion events.", "gpt35": "Stars form in dense and cool molecular clouds. When the density is high enough, the matter collapses and forms a young stellar object (YSO). In the early phases, the thick envelope dominates the emission from the YSO. Eventually, the envelope flattens out into a circumstellar accretion disk, which causes an infrared (IR) excess. This IR excess can be used to distinguish YSOs from main-sequence stars. The accretion disk does not reach the central star, as the inner edge is truncated by the stellar magnetic field. The dust in the disk condenses into planets, is blown out by accretion-driven disk and stellar winds, or is accreted onto the central star. YSOs can exhibit variability due to stellar rotation periods, cool and hot spots caused by magnetic activity, and variable extinction events. Variability can occur on short timescales of hours or longer timescales of years. Multiple processes can contribute to observed variability in YSOs, depending on the properties of each object.", "human": "the emission from young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the mid - ir is dominated by the inner rim of their circumstellar disks . \n we present an ir -

hydrodynamical instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n t  tauri stars ( tts ) were originally identified by their variability @xcite  long before anybody realized that tts are indeed pre - main sequence stars . \n the dominant timescale in the optical is the stellar rotation period , typically a few days to a week or more . \n ysos can have cool spots caused by magnetic activity similar to our sun and also hot spots which mark the impact points of the accretion funnels onto the stellar surface ( see , e.g. , review by * ? ? ? \n this impact happens at free - fall velocities up to 500  km  s@xmath1 ; thus , the accretion shock heats the accreted mass to x - ray emitting temperatures . in the optical \n , the accretion region appears as emission that often is approximated as a blackbody with temperature @xmath2  k ( @xcite , but see also @xcite who argue that line emission contributes to the veiling in addition to a continuum ) . \n variability in the mass accretion rate can lead to changes in the hot spot signatures . \n the dynamical timescale that controls the accretion is the keplerian period of the inner disk where the accretion funnels start . \n the inner disk radius is found close to the co - rotation radius leading to a typical timescale of a few hours for typical masses and rotation periods of ysos . indeed optical variability with amplitudes around 0.1  mag \n is often observed in ctts on this timescale @xcite . \n another source of variability related to the accretion could be oscillations of the accretion shock on timescales of seconds . \n this has been predicted theoretically ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ) , but is not observed so far , possibly because the accretion spot separates into many small funnels that oscillate independently at different phases and frequencies . \n however , @xcite find indications that strong accretion in v1647  ori could excite radial pulsations of the star itself . \n one of the largest classes of short timescale ( @xmath3 days ) optical and ir variability in ysos is that due to variable extinction events @xcite . \n these come in three categories - aa tau - type variables ( stars with broad , periodic flux dips , whose amplitudes can be up to a magnitude or more in the optical ) , presumably due to our line of sight passing through a warp in the inner circumstellar disk ; stars with similar or narrower flux dips that have no obvious periodicity - presumably due to stars where our line of sight passes close to the disk and where disk instabilities can levitate dust high enough above the plane to intersect our line of sight briefly ; and stars with narrow , periodic flux dips - perhaps where our line of sight is being intersected by dust entrained in material accreting onto the star in a funnel flow . about 20% of the ysos in ngc  2264 fall into one of these categories in the sample of @xcite . \n ysos can also vary on much longer timescales . \n variability on the timescales of years could be caused by changing circumstellar extinction for a keplarian disk around a solar - mass yso this timescale translates to a radius of a few au ) or by massive accretion events when a significant fraction of the disk mass drains onto the yso @xcite . in this case \n the accretion luminosity can outshine the yso by orders of magnitudes and it takes months to years ( in the case of exor outbursts , * ? ? ? * ) or even centuries until the accretion decays back down to the original level . \n in any lightcurve , several of the processes dicussed above can contibute to the observed variability at the same time and it depends on the properties of each object which one dominates and if secondary effects can be detected in the lightcurve . \n for example , cool spots , hot spots , absorption , and massive accretion events can all influence the same optical light curve . \n another case are x - rays , where the flux and the spectrum can change due to periodic absorption , variability in the accretion rate ( tw  hya , * ? ? ? \n * ) or coronal activity similar to what is seen on the sun . in most ysos , \n the last point is dominant and x - ray lightcurves often show the fast rise in flux and temperature and a slower decay characteristic of coronal activity ( see , e.g. , the _ chandra _ monitoring of the orion nebular cluster , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) .    the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of ysos in the optical is dominated by the stellar photosphere and the accretion spot . \n thus , optical monitoring is very effective for understanding the stellar rotation and the accreting spot . \n however , the disk radiates mostly at longer wavelengths , which are probed in the ir observations presented in this article . \n depending on the mass of the disk and the size of the inner hole , the disk will start to dominate the sed at the @xmath4 band or in the irac bands at @xmath5 m and @xmath6 m . \n simple disk models still treat the disk as a static and axisymmetric structure , but observationally it now seems that the disk is in fact `` a bubbling , boiling , wrinkled , dented , warped mass of gas and dust '' @xcite , see also @xcite . \n this paper is part of the ysovar ( young stellar object variability ) project , which has monitored the ( onc ) and eleven smaller star forming regions with irac in @xmath5 m and @xmath6 m to understand the mid -

cloud of the @xmath7  ophiuchus star forming region , one of the best - studied young clusters in the sky ( see e.g.  review by * ? ? ? \n the central region of l1688 is very dense and deeply embedded ( @xmath8  mag , see figure  [ fig : map ] ) . \n thus , all surveys of the regions necessarily miss some cluster members . \n an extinction limited , spectroscopic survey @xcite finds an average age of 3.1  myr for a 6.8  pc@xmath9 region centered on l1688 and no significant deviation from the initial mass function . \n earlier studies concentrated on the deeper embedded core and found a much younger age of 0.3  myr . \n some , but not all , of this difference is due to the specific reddening laws or pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks used in these studies ( see discussion in * ? ? ? \n @xcite present photometric and spectroscopic monitoring for five ysos in l1688 nearly simultaneous with the _ spitzer _ observations discussed here . \n they do not see any correlation between the hydrogen emission lines that are usually considered accretion indicators and the features in the ir lightcurves of their targets , indicating that the relatively modest variability they observed is not caused by changes in the accretion rate . \n additional notable objects with well - sampled nir lightcurves are @xcite and , which show eclipses with periods of 131 and 93  days , respectively . these sources can be interpreted as multiple systems , where one or more components are eclipsed by a warped circumstellar disk . \n thus far , the most comprehensive study of near - ir variability of ysos in l1688 is @xcite ( see references therein for other ir variability studies ) , who make use of a two micron all sky survey ( 2mass * ? ? ? \n * ) calibration field that overlaps l1688 so each source has up to 1584 datapoints in @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath4 spanning 2.5  years . \n they find 79% of the known ysos to be variable . in total , \n 32 sources are periodic ( including cool starspots , hot accretion spots and 6 systems with eclipses ) , 31 sources show a long - term trend and 40 sources vary aperiodically on shorter timescales . \n the new data presented in this article complements the @xcite study with observations at longer wavelengths . \n in this section we briefly describe the data reduction for the _ spitzer _ and _ chandra _ observations . \n a detailed account of the observations , data processing and the source extraction is given in paper  i. we also give an overview of auxiliary data on the stellar properties retrieved from the literature , which we need to test if the variability characteristics depend on the central star . \n we then assess the cluster membership and sed class for every source with a usable lightcurve . \n ccc 29267200 & 2010 -

of - view are non - overlapping . thus , \n each target field is observed in two consecutive pointings , one for each channel . \n a secondary field is observed in the secondary channel while the primary channel is observing the target field . in visibility windows 1 and 3 , \n sources south of the main fields have only irac  1 data , while those to the north only have irac  2 data . in visibility windows 2 and 4 , \n the situation is reversed . \n not all sources in the central fields have usable data in both bands , because they might be too bright or too faint in one channel , or fall on the edge of the map . \n additional sources with two band coverage are found where the northern side field of one target field overlaps with the southern side field of another target field . \n here we summarize the main data reduction and processing steps described in detail in paper  i. basic calibrated data ( bcd ) are obtained from the _ spitzer _ archive . \n further data reduction is performed with the idl package cluster grinder @xcite , that treats each bcd image for bright source artifacts . \n aperture photometry is performed on individual bcds with an aperture radius of @xmath13 . to increase the signal - to - noise ratio and to reject cosmic rays , the photometry from all bcds in each observation \n is combined . \n the reported value is the average brightness of all bcds within that observation that contain the source in question , after rejecting outliers . \n the photometric uncertainties obtained from the aperture photometry are , particularly for faint sources , only lower limits to the total uncertainty , since distributed nebulosity often found in star forming regions can contribute to the noise . \n to improve these estimates , paper  i introduces an error floor value that is added in quadrature to the uncertainties of individual photometric points . \n the value of the error floor is 0.01  mag for irac  1 and 0.007  mag for irac  2 . \n we cross - match sources from individual observations with a matching radius of @xmath14 with each other and with the 2mass catalog , which is used as a coordinate reference . \n all photometric measurements performed in the context of the ysovar project are collected in a central database , which we intend to deliver to the infrared science archive ( irsa ) for general distribution . \n data for this article were retrieved from the ysovar database on 2013 - 10 - 31 and further processed using custom routines in python available at https://github.com/ysovar . \n we visually checked all frames for lightcurves that are classified as variable in section  [ sect : midirvariability ] and removed datapoints visibly affected by instrumental artifacts ( cosmic rays , read - out streaks for bright neighbors ) . \n figure  [ fig : map ] shows the distribution of the sources with lightcurves in our input catalog overlayed on a larger irac  1 map observed during the cryogenic mission .    in this article \n , we consider only objects that have at least five datapoints in our irac  1 or irac  2 lightcurves . \n a stricter definition is employed in paper  i , where only sources with more than five datapoints _ in the fast - cadence data ( first visibility window ) _ are used . in l1688 , 822 of the total list of 882 sources fullfill this stricter condition . in table \n [ tab : tab2 ] they are marked in the column ` standardset ` .      despite the careful data reduction described above \n , some residual artifacts remain in the _ spitzer _ lightcurves . in this section \n , we search for artifacts that are related to the position on the detector . compared with other clusters in the ysovar project \n , l1688 is particularly suited to discover these kinds of effects because the fields observed in l1688 have almost no rotation within one visibility window . \n the spacecraft orientation flips between visibility windows , so that most instrumental artifacts produce lightcurves that have one level in visibility window 1 and 3 and another level in visibility window 2 and 4 . \n figure  [ fig : instrumentallcs ] shows sources with a magnitude between 8 and 15 in @xmath6 m , that might fall in this category . \n the relative difference in magnitude is smaller for brighter sources , but since the photometric errors are also smaller these instrumental effects can still be significant . \n we visually inspected every frame for a sample of sources with lightcurves similar to those in figure  [ fig : instrumentallcs ] to identify the cause for the artifacts . \n we found that several different effects can cause these steps in the lightcurve . \n some sources are close to a detector edge , such that the background is not well - determined , some are in the wings of the point - spread function ( psf ) of a bright neighbor , and some show residuals from hot pixels . \n proximity to a detector edge or hot pixel affects only one of the spacecraft orientations ; even the psf wings change with the orientation since the psf is not circular . \n sufficiently strong intrinsic variability can mask this offset between visibility windows and for any individual source , this instrumental effect can not be distinguished from intrinsic variability with a period of one year . \n thus , we use a statistical approach to quantify the number of lightcurves that suffer from this problem . for each channel \n , we have about 200 lightcurves with datapoints in all four observing visibility windows ( the total number of lightcurves is larger , but only for sources in the three target fields do we have data for all four visibility windows ) . \n if the mean magnitude in a visibility window depends on the detector position of the source , this source will on average be brighter in visibility window 1 and 3 and fainter in visibility window 2 and 4 ( or vice - versa ) . \n we calculate the mean magnitude in each visibility window and test whether the two brightest mean magnitudes belong to visibility window [ 1,3 ] or [ 2,4 ] or any other combination ( [ 1,2 ] , [ 1,4 ] , [ 2,3 ] , [ 3,4 ] ) . \n we use the following abbreviated notation : when we calculate the mean magnitudes in each visibility window for a sample of @xmath15 sources , then @xmath16:@xmath17:@xmath18 means that @xmath16 sources have the brightest mean magnitudes in visibility windows [ 1,3 ] , @xmath17 sources in visibility windows [ 2,4 ] and @xmath18 sources have their two brightest mean magnitudes in any other combination of visibility windows . \n if the difference in the mean magnitude between visibility windows is unrelated to the position on the detector , we expect the ratio @xmath1917%:17%:67% . \n in contrast , the observed lightcurves have the ratio 47:66:75=25%:35%:40% for irac  1 and 52:59:95=25%:29%:46% for irac  2 . \n this is incompatible with the expected multinomial distribution ( the probability to observe a distribution at least as far from the expected @xmath20 by chance is @xmath21 ) . in each case , about 50 lightcurves , a quarter of the sample , need to be shifted from the first two bins to the last bin to make the observed distribution compatible with the expected distribution . \n this implies that about a quarter of all lightcurves suffer from the artifacts described above . \n however , both irac channels use independent detectors and thus the chance that both channels are affected for the same source and that the effect goes the same way ( bright - faint , vs. faint - bright ) is low .    below in section \n [ sect : midirvariability ] we identify variable sources using a stetson and a @xmath22 test . \n the limits in those tests are designed to be conservative and indeed we find a distribution of 5:7:24=14%:19%:67% for irac  1 and 5:5:27=14%:14%:73% for irac  2 , when we restrict the sample to those lightcurves that will be classified as variable below . \n both ratios are fully compatible with the expected multinomial distribution @xmath20 . \n this shows that the limits we apply are conservative enough that the sample of stars we identify as variable has no or only few sources where the variability is not due to intrinsic source variability . \n therefore it is not necessary to remove any source based on magnitude jumps between visibility windows . \n only one of the four lightcurves shown in figure  [ fig : instrumentallcs ] ( sstysv j162727.53 - 242611.2 ) will be identified as variable below . \n we visually inspected all lightcurves that are marked as variable and , apart form the example shown above , we did not see lightcurves where the variability seems to be due to the pattern discussed in this section .    in summary , \n about a quarter of all lightcurves are affected by detector position dependent artifacts . in extreme cases , \n the associated jumps reach 0.5  mag for a 14  mag source , and up to 0.05  mag in bright sources around 8  mag . \n however , we show statistically that the definition of variability we use is so conservative that this effect does not contribute a significant number of objects to our sample of variable sources . \n disk - bearing ysos can be identified from _ spitzer _ \n data alone , but information in other spectral bands is required to find the other cluster members . \n x - ray observations are one way to identify diskless ( class  iii ) ysos . in the ir \n the seds of those sources are indistinguishable from a main - sequence field star , but due to their rapid rotation , ysos are much brighter in x - rays than field stars . \n l1688 was observed by _ \n chandra _ on 2000 - 04 - 13 for 100  ks exposure time in the ` faint ` mode with the acis instrument ( ) . \n we reprocessed this exposure with the anchors pipeline @xcite using a recent calibration ; see discussion in paper  i. these data has been analyzed in detail to study the distribution of x - ray properties in ctts and to identify brown dwarfs in this star forming region @xcite .    during the observation , \n five acis chips were operational , four from the central acis - i imaging array , as well as one acis - s chip . \n the point - spread - function ( psf ) degrades significantly for sources located off - axis , and thus the coordinates of the outer sources are less reliable . \n to cross - match x - ray sources with _ \n sources we used a matching radius of 1 for x - ray sources within 3 of the optical axis of _ chandra _ , 1.5 for sources between 3 and 6 away from the optical axis and 2 for all sources located further than 6 from the optical axis . \n the observed _ chandra _ field overlaps about two thirds of the area covered in the _ spitzer _ monitoring . \n however , the variable psf leads to a sensitivity that varies over the observed field , thus the absence of an x - ray detection for _ spitzer _ sources does not necessarily imply the absence of x - ray emission . \n the acis detector has an intrinsic energy resolution , and we use the net flux to characterize the x - ray properties . for sources with more than 20 counts , we also fit an absorbed single - temperature apec model @xcite with abundances fixed at 0.3 times the solar value from @xcite . \n sources are extracted down to a very low significance . in total , there are 315 detected x - ray sources , but only 31 of them match an object with a _ spitzer _ \n we disregard all unmatched sources ; for sources with a lightcurve and an x - ray counterpart , the x - ray properties are given in table  [ tab : tab2 ] . to estimate the number of spurious matches , we multiply the fraction of the total survey area that is included in the positional error circles of the x - ray sources with the number of _ spitzer _ sources with lightcurves . \n the result is the average number of spurious matches . \n we expect at most 2 - 4 _ spitzer _ sources to be matched to a spurious x - ray source . \n x - ray sources that are cross - matched successfully are marked in figure  [ fig : map ] . \n the star forming region l1688 has been the target of intense study over the past decades and a wealth of additional information exists in the literature . in particular \n , we refer the reader to two reviews @xcite . \n the latter review compiles a list of objects with a high probability of membership from a variety of published sources . \n the membership criteria employed are ( i )  x - ray emission , which at the distance of l1688 is detectable only from young , and thus active stars ; ( ii )  optical spectroscopy , with h@xmath23 in emission or li in absorption ; ( iii )  a location above the main - sequence in the hr diagram ; or ( iv )  ir emission that is indicative of a circumstellar disk . \n l1688 was also observed with _ \n spitzer _ in the cryogenic mission phase with all four irac channels and the 24@xmath24 m channel of the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips , * ? ? ? \n objects classified as ysos from these data @xcite are already contained in the membership list of @xcite . \n we augment our own _ spitzer _ \n data reduction with values from the catalog published by the c2d project ( c2d =  from cores to disks  ; * ? ? ? \n if we did not obtain a photometric value for an irac band or the @xmath25 m mips , but a value with the quality specifier a , b or c is present in the c2d catalog then we use that value . the data are given in table  [ tab : tab2 ] , which specifies if a datapoint is taken from our own data reduction (  g09  : using the pipeline from * ? ? ? * ) or the c2d database .    near - ir data \n is taken from 2mass @xcite and cross - matched by the cluster grinder pipeline @xcite . \n additionally , we take detections from the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ) galactic cluster survey , data release 9 . \n the ukidss project is defined in @xcite . \n ukidss uses the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) wide field camera and a photometric system described in @xcite . \n the pipeline processing and science archive are described in @xcite . \n we only retain detections with a ` mergedclass ` flag between -3 and 0 . \n sources brighter than @xmath26  mag can be saturated and we discard the ukidss data for any source that lies above this threshold either in ukidss or 2mass . \n this leaves us with 2mass data in the range @xmath27  mag and ukidss @xmath28  mag . \n the luminosity function for both dataset is almost identical from @xmath26 to @xmath29 . for fainter sources , \n 2mass is incomplete ; ukidss is incomplete for @xmath30  mag . \n the ysovar data is also cross - matched with data from the simbad service to provide an identification with known objects from the literature . in all cases the matching radius is set to @xmath14 . if a catalog contains multiple entries within @xmath14 of a ysovar source , we match it to the closest catalog entry . in some cases \n the best cross - match is not obvious . \n those sources are discussed in appendix  [ sect : remarksaboutcrossmatchingindividualsources ] . \n ukidss has a better spatial resolution than our irac data . \n there are nine sources where more than one ukidss source is found within the size of the aperture we use for irac photometry . in six cases ( wsb 52 , iso - oph 152 , iso - oph 131 , sstysv j162728.13 - 243719.6 , sstysv j162718.11 - 244814.1 , sstysv j162718.25 - 244955.8 ) \n the second source is visible in the @xmath31 band , the ukidss band that is closest in wavelength to the irac data , so it is likely that both sources contribute to the observed irac emission . in the remaining three cases ( iso - oph 28 , iso - oph 57 , sstysv j162741.14 - 242038.3 ) the second source is not visible at @xmath31 band . \n ccccc 1 & ra & deg &  & j2000.0 right ascension + 2 & dec & deg &  & j2000.0 declination + 3 & name &  &  & identifier for object + 4 & iau_name &  &  & j2000.0 iau designation within the ysovar program + 5 & other_names &  &  & alternative identifiers for object + 6 & c2d_id & &  &  + 7 & wil08_id &  &  & wilking et al . \n ( 2008 ) + 8 & adoc08_aoc &  &  & j2000.0 iau designation ( jhhmmss.ss+ddmmss.s ) + 9 & ukidss_sourceid &  &  &  + 10 & jmag & mag & @xmath10 &  + 11 & e_jmag & mag & @xmath10 & observational uncertainty + 12 & r_jmag &  & @xmath10 & data source + 13 & hmag & mag & @xmath11 &  + 14 & e_hmag & mag & @xmath11 & observational uncertainty + 15 & r_hmag &  & @xmath11 & data source + 16 & kmag & mag & @xmath31 &  + 17 & e_kmag & mag & @xmath31 & observational uncertainty + 18 & r_kmag &  & @xmath31 & data source + 19 & 3.6mag & mag & @xmath32 m &  + 20 & e_3.6mag & mag & @xmath32 m & observational uncertainty + 21 & r_3.6mag &  & @xmath32 m & data source + 22 & 4.5mag & mag & @xmath33 m &  + 23 & e_4.5mag & mag & @xmath33 m & observational uncertainty + 24 & r_4.5mag &  & @xmath33 m & data source + 25 & 5.8mag & mag & @xmath34 m &  + 26 & e_5.8mag & mag & @xmath34 m & observational uncertainty + 27 & r_5.8mag &  & @xmath34 m & data source + 28 & 8.0mag & mag & @xmath35 m &  + 29 & e_8.0mag & mag & @xmath35 m & observational uncertainty + 30 & r_8.0mag &  & @xmath35 m & data source + 31 & 24mag & mag & @xmath36 m &  + 32 & e_24mag & mag & @xmath36 m & observational uncertainty + 33 & r_24mag &  & @xmath36 m & data source + 34 & sedclass &  &  & ir class according to sed slope + 35 & s1_sedclass &  &  & ir class according to sed slope ( visibility window 1 ) + 36 & member(ysovar ) &  &  & cluster membership according to ysovar standard + 37 & standardset &  &  & source in ysovar standard set ? + 38 & ns1_36 & ct & @xmath32 m & number of datapoints ( visibility window 1 ) + 39 & ns1_45 & ct & @xmath33 m & number of datapoints ( visibility window 1 ) + 40 & maxs1_36 & mag & @xmath32 m & maximum magnitude in lightcurve ( visibility window 1 ) + 41 & mins1_36 & mag & @xmath32 m & minimum magnitude in lightcurve ( visibility window 1 ) + 42 & maxs1_45 & mag & @xmath33 m & maximum magnitude in lightcurve ( visibility window 1 ) + 43 & mins1_45 & mag & @xmath33 m & minimum magnitude in lightcurve ( visibility window 1 ) + 44 & means1_36 & mag & @xmath32 m & mean magnitude ( visibility window 1 ) + 45 & stddevs1_36 & mag & @xmath32 m & standard deviation calculated from non -

ray sources in _ chandra _ imaging and have a spectral slope compatible with a stellar photosphere ( sed class  iii , see section  [ sect : spectralslope ] ) . at the distance of l1688 \n ( we use 120  pc from , but see also discussion in paper  i ) , cluster members that are young and thus still magnetically active stars can be detected in x - rays . \n a total of 57 sources fulfill one or both conditions . in table \n [ tab : tab2 ] , these objects are marked as `` member ( ysovar ) '' . \n the main biases in this sample are that the ir criterion selects only those members with disks and not class  iii sources , while the _ chandra _ criterion suffers from incomplete spatial coverage and it may include late - type foreground stars . \n the different biases are a common problem in multiwavelength studies of star forming regions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n the second membership list is taken from @xcite . on this list , 74 of our 884 sources with _ \n lightcurves are cluster members ; 51 of those 74 are also included in the ysovar membership list due to their x - ray or ir emission . \n when we compare properties of members and non - members below without referring to a specific set , then we mean membership as defined by the standard ysovar criteria . \n six sources in the ysovar standard member set are not part of the @xcite list . \n more details on those source are given in appendix  [ sect : g09notwil ] . \n on the other hand , all of the sources in @xcite that are not part of the ysovar standard set were selected based on an x - ray detection from observations other than _ chandra _ ( for the specific references see * ? ? ? \n figure  [ fig : hist36 ] shows a histogram of the observed mean magnitudes in @xmath32 m . \n almost all bright sources are cluster members . \n the fraction of members drops below 11th  mag and no cluster member is found below 14th  mag . \n we expect background sources to be fainter than cluster members because of their larger distance and because they are seen through the cloud , but also fainter sources can not be reliably classified . \n the thickness of the cloud is inhomogenous . \n the three primary fields cover roughly @xmath38  mag in the extinction maps from the c2d project @xcite . \n this correspondes to @xmath39}=1.3 - 2.2 $ ]  mag @xcite . at the distance of l1688 , a k5 star with little or no extinction \n has @xmath40 } = 12.2 $ ]  mag according to the evolutionary tracks of and the yso colors from @xcite . \n thus , even late - k or early - m star members in the cloud are bright enough to be detected . \n just over 10% of the 884 sources with lightcurves are classified by @xcite at all , because this classification scheme is conservative , representing a set of sources that can be dereddened and classified to a high degree of confidence . \n however , for many sources , we lack the required spectral coverage . of those sources that can be classified in this way , 16 \n are class  i sources , 36 are class  ii sources and 59 are class  iii candidates , i.e. , sources with a weak or absent ir excess in their sed ( in this case the ir sed does not provide sufficient information to decide if a star is a yso or a field star ) . \n ten of those 59 have an x - ray counterpart in our _ chandra _ data .    in order to classify all sources , including those not classified in @xcite , paper  i defines a simpler approach , which uses the observed colors only . in this scheme \n , we fit the spectral slope @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the wavelength and @xmath43 the flux density per unit wavelength interval at that wavelength . \n we make use of all measured flux densities ( no upper limits ) in the 2 - 24@xmath12 m range , which corresponds to the range from the @xmath4 or @xmath31 filter , which we take from 2mass and/or ukidss , respectively , to the mips 24@xmath12 m channel . \n we use the flux densities for all _ spitzer _ bands from the observations presented in @xcite ( and we include all sources extracted using this pipeline including those that are not published in @xcite because they are not classified as yso in that work ) or c2d and summarize the new lightcurves by calculating the mean and standard deviation for the new irac1 and irac2 data . \n thus , sources detected both in the cryogenic mission and in the new dataset will have two datapoints for irac1 and irac2 . \n if a source is detected in both 2mass and ukidss we use both values for the fit , since they are independent measurements . \n we perform a least - squares fit and call sources with @xmath44 class  i , @xmath45 flat - spectrum ( f ) , @xmath46 class  ii sources and @xmath47 class  iii candidates . \n the classifications are given in table  [ tab : tab2 ] in two columns . ` \n s1_sedclass ` presents the derived sed class using all available literature data as described above and the mean of the lightcurves from visibility window  1 for comparison with paper  i ; ` sedclass ` uses the same literature data but the mean flux density for the lightcurves calculated for all visibility windows . in this scheme \n a significantly reddened main - sequence star , which has an intrinsic slope @xmath48 , may appear as class  ii object , so this observational classification can not be translated directly into the evolutionary stage of an object . of the remaining sources we find 110 class  i , 78 flat - spectrum and 455 class  ii sources and 221 class  iii candidates . \n we can not classify 20 sources , because they are seen in one band only .    not only the evolutionary status but also other properties of the individual source such as inclination or stellar mass influence the value of @xmath23 . \n massive stars emit more energetic radiation and can thus change the structure of the accretion disk . \n however , l1688 is a region without massive ysos @xcite and we define @xmath23 using wavelengths longward of the @xmath31 band far from the peak of the stellar sed , so the shape of the photospheric sed has only negligible influence on the total sed . \n @xcite simulated different ysos of low mass . \n their results show that seds depend mostly on the evolutionary stage except for very extreme cases such as stars with an edge - on disk . \n thus , @xmath23 provides a good proxy for the evolutionary state of the ysos in l1688 . \n comparing with @xcite , the resulting classification is very similar , particularly for the class  i and flat - spectrum sources . \n most sources with a spectral slope @xmath49 according to our slope - fitting are class  i sources in both classification schemes . with two exceptions \n our flat - spectrum sources are either class  i or ii in @xcite . of the 52 sources with a spectral slope between -1.6 and -0.3 , 21 \n are also called class  ii by @xcite , but 30 are class  iii in that paper , indicating that a significant fraction of what we call class  ii might indeed be reddened background stars . the general agreement between the more complex classification scheme and the observed spectral slope is also found for other star forming regions ( paper  i ) . \n we use three different methods to detect variability in all lightcurves , independent of their membership status or sed slope . \n sources are considered variable , if they fullfill at least one of the following conditions : ( i ) a two - band lightcurve exisits and their stetson index is larger than 0.9 ( sect .  [ sect : stetsonindex ] ) ; ( ii ) only a one - band lightcurve exisits and @xmath50 ( sect . \n [ sect : chi2 ] ) ; ( iii ) the lightcurve is periodic ( sect . \n [ sect : periodicity ] ) . \n sources in the target fields are observed in irac  1 and irac  2 almost simultaneously ( within a few minutes ) . for those sources , \n we calculate the stetson index @xmath51 with points weighted evenly @xcite : @xmath52 where the sum is taken over all @xmath53 pairs of observations in irac1 and irac2 with observed magnitudes @xmath54 and @xmath55 and uncertainties @xmath56 and @xmath57 ; @xmath58 denotes the sign of @xmath59 . \n @xmath59 is the product of the normalized residuals in both bands : @xmath60 here @xmath61 denotes the error - weighted mean of all irac  1 magnitudes and @xmath62 the error - weighted mean of all irac  2 magnitudes . \n the stetson index is very robust to observational errors since those are unlikely to affect both bands in the same way . \n following paper  i , we define a source as variable if @xmath63 . in paper \n i , this is calculated over the first visibility window only ; in this article we use the lightcurve from all four visibility windows . the stetson index calculated for the first visibility window only can be found in table  [ tab : tab2 ] in column ` s1_stetson_36_45 ` and for the entire lightcurve in column ` stetson_36_45 ` . \n figure [ fig : stetsonlcs ] shows examples of lightcurves that are classified as variable according to the stetson index . in the first visibility window , we find 34 sources to be variable , that is 18% of all lightcurves where we can calculate the stetson index . \n the number is similar ( 38 sources , 18% ) if we consider all observing visibility windows . \n this is not surprising , given that the stetson index is designed to be a `` robust '' statistic that is little influenced by a small number of datapoints , and compared to the first visibility window , the other visibility windows only contribute a small number of datapoints . \n we caution that equation  [ eqn : stetson ] will introduce a systematic bias in such a way that a source that is variable in only one band will not be recognized as variable . \n [ sect : chi2 ]    for sources outside the primary target fields or for sources which are too bright or too faint in one irac channel , the stetson index can not be calculated . for those sources we rely on the reduced chi - squared value to detect variability : @xmath64 instrumental uncertainties lead to a non - gaussian error distribution , \n so we use a conservative cut - off and mark sources as variable only if @xmath65 ( paper  i ) . using this metric \n , we find 22 sources that exhibit variability in irac1 and 18 that exhibit variability in irac2 . \n for comparison , we note that of the 38 sources classified as variable according to their stetson index in the last section , 34 are also variable according to the @xmath22 test for their irac1 lightcurve and 37 according to their irac2 lightcurve . \n the @xmath66 calculated for the first visibility window only can be found in table  [ tab : tab2 ] in column ` redchi2tomeans1_36 ` and ` redchi2tomeans1_45 ` for irac  i and irac  2 , respectively , and for the entire lightcurve in columns ` redchi2tomean_36 ` and ` redchi2tomean_45 ` , again for irac  1 and irac  2 , respectively . \n examples are shown in figure  [ fig : chi2lc ] . if we fit a linear slope instead of comparing to the mean ( i.e.  a constant ) , the results are the same . \n many sources have significantly larger values of @xmath66 for the whole observation series than within one visibility window , indicating a constant luminosity over 40  days , but a change over timescales between six months and two years . \n ccccc cfhtwir -

scargle periodogram ; again , see paper  i for details . we require a false alarm probability @xmath67 and to further reduce the number of false positives , we additionally run a period detection of all lightcurves on the nasa exoplanet archive periodogram service . \n this service employs several algorithms because each algorithm is particularly suited to a different signal shape ( see paper  i or the website for details on the other algorithms ) . \n we also calculate the autocorrelation function of each signal . \n we find that the lomb - scargle periodogram is advantageous for lightcurves with @xmath68 points as is the case for most of our data . \n we require that at least one of three supplementary algorithms that we run retrieves a periodicity with a similar timescale ( see paper  i for details ) . \n we only search for periods between 0.1 and 14.5 days , so that at least three periods fit in each visibility window . \n allowing longer periods leads to the detection of many long - term trends , where the data do not show that these trends are actually periodic . \n finally , all algorithmically detected periodicity is vetted by eye . \n if periods are found in multiple bands , we report the period in irac  1 , which is generally the most reliable due to the lower measurement uncertainties . \n if irac  1 does not reveal a periodicity , we report the value for the irac  2 lightcurve , and , as a last resort the period found in the [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] color to include objects where a periodic signal is overlayed by a long - term trend so that it is undetectable in each individual channel , but might be visible in the color . \n the final list of adopted periods is given in table  [ tab : period ] . \n it contains sources from all sed classes . \n we find 14 sources that show a periodic behavior in the first visibility window , but this periodicity is not stable over more than one visibility window . \n the datapoints taken in the first visibility window follow the folded period much better than the data from the later visibility windows , indicating that the period is not stable for longer than a few months . in roxn  41 , \n the datapoints of the later visibility windows , folded with the same period , seem to follow a different , yet clearly defined lightcurve with a similar period . \n ten periodic sources have information in both irac bands . \n eight of those are already classified as variable by the stetson index . \n three out of four sources with data in one band only are variable according to the @xmath66 test . \n the remaining two sources with information in both irac bands show periodicty , but fail the stetson index test because a larger variability amplitude is required for a significant detection in stetson index , which does not make any assumption about the form of the variability compared with the lomb - scargle periodigram , that only detects periodic signals . \n equally , the remaining source with data in only one band fails the @xmath66 test , because the @xmath66 test also requires a larger variability amplitude for a significant detection than the lomb - scarge periodogram . \n the number of datapoints in visibility windows 2 , 3 , and 4 is too low to search for periodicity in those visibility windows alone . \n figure  [ fig : periodlc ] shows the phase - folded lightcurve in one band for six periodic sources where the periodicity is significant in a single band . \n figure  [ fig : periodcolorlc ] shows the phased lightcurve for , where the period is seen only in the color term [ 3.6]-[4.5 ] . \n most of the periods found in table  [ tab : period ] are in the range 3 - 7 days . \n only two sources have longer periods of 11 and 14 days . \n the largest amplitude is around 0.3  mag , and the smallest around 0.05  mag . \n all periodic sources except roxn  41 , sstysv j162636.08 - 242404.2 , 2mass j16271881 - 2448523 , and sstysv j162622.19 - 242352.2 are cluster members according to our membership criteria . \n roxn  41 and sstysv j162636.08 - 242404.2 have class i and ii seds , respectively . \n all but cfhtwir - oph  29 ( see appendix  [ sect : g09notwil ] ) , sstysv j162636.08 - 242404.2 ( see appendix  [ sect : g09notwil ] ) , and 2mass j16271881 - 2448523 ( no information beyond the @xmath69 magnitudes is available in the literature ) are cluster members according to @xcite . \n ten of the 56 cluster members are periodic ; in total there are 14 periodic sources out of 60 sources that are variable in the first visibility window . in comparison \n , @xcite find 18% of all variable stars to be periodic in @xmath70 monitoring of the orion  a molecular cloud with a similar time coverage as we have for l1688 . \n @xcite find a third of all variable stars in l1688 to be periodic ; due to their longer time baseline , @xcite are sensitive to different periods , but only 4 out of their 32 periods have values that are outside of the range we could detect \n see their table . \n we are sensitive to periods of up to 14.5  days here . \n the largest group of lightcurves in the sample of l1688 does not have any significant variability . \n the lower limit where variability is detected depends on the brightness of the object - fainter sources need a stronger relative variability due to the larger measurement uncertainties . \n paper  i presents monte - carlo simulations to show that the stetson test finds variability when the amplitude is a few times larger than the average uncertainty ; the exact number depends on the signal shape . \n for example , the variability in a source that switches between two discrete levels will be detected when the amplitude is at least twice the uncertainty ( @xmath71  mag for a star with magnitude 14 ) . \n if data from only one band are available , the step size must be more than four times the uncertainty to be found by the @xmath22-test ( @xmath72  mag for a star with magnitude 14 . ) . \n given the observing cadence , the monte - carlo simulations show that we are sensitive to periods between 0.1 and 14.5 days ( paper  i ) . \n in summary , we call a source variable if it is either periodic with a low false alarm probability ( 14 sources ) or fulfills one of the following conditions : sources with simultaneous data in two bands need to have a stetson index @xmath73 ( 34 sources in the ysovar standard set fast cadence data and 38 sources in total ) and sources without simultaneous data need to have @xmath65 ( 22 sources in the ysovar standard set fast cadence data and 29 sources in total ) . \n we consider the lightcurves for all 882 distinct sources with at least five datapoints in at least one irac band . of those lightcurves , \n 70 are classified as variable ; 56 sources are cluster members according to the ysovar criteria ( 44 of them are variable ) and 73 sources are cluster members according to @xcite ( 47 of them are variable ) . \n both membership samples have considerable overlap .    in the following subsections , \n we compare properties of the lightcurves between different sed classes . in most cases , the lightcurves of irac1 ( 3.6@xmath12 m ) and irac2 ( @xmath6 m ) have very similar properties . \n figure  [ fig : probvarsed ] contains the variability fraction sorted by sed class ( see section  [ sect : spectralslope ] ) . within each class , \n the population is sub - divided into previously identified members , bright ( @xmath74  mag in @xmath32 m or @xmath33 m ) stars not previously identified as members , and faint ( @xmath75  mag ) stars not previously identified as members . \n sources are considered variable if they have a low false alarm probability for periodicity or a stetson index @xmath73 ( if simultaneous data in irac  1 and irac  2 exist ) or @xmath76 ( if no simultaneous data exist ) . \n note that the classes shown here are based on the observed sed and thus background non - member stars seen through the cloud might appear red ( like a class ii source ) even if their intrinsic sed slope is compatible with sed class  iii . \n no star classified as a member is fainter than 14  mag \n .    the observed fraction of variable stars as a function of sed class is the best guess for the probability to find variability for a star of a given sed class . \n we calculate the uncertainty for the probability based on the observed number of variable stars @xmath77 in a bin with @xmath53 total sources as follows : if the true probability for a source in the bin to be variable is @xmath78 , then the probability to observe @xmath77 variables in @xmath53 stars is given by @xmath79 , which follows a binomial distribution : @xmath80 the peak of this distribution is @xmath81 . \n we then calculate the boundaries of the confidence interval @xmath82 for @xmath78 such that @xmath83 and the area under the curve includes 68% of the probability . \n those uncertainty ranges are shown in figure  [ fig : probvarsed ] . \n almost all known cluster members are variable ; the fraction of variables is decreasing slightly from class  i to ii . \n there are five class  iii members and none of them shows variability . \n this is compatible with the variability fraction observed for class  iii non - members . by definition \n , sources with a class  iii sed do not have a large ir excess over a stellar photosphere , thus they are not expected to harbor a substantial disk or show disk - related variability . \n however , even field stars can show significant variability , at least in the near - ir . \n @xcite find 1.6% of all field stars to be variable in @xmath69 . \n this includes eclipsing systems , stars with unusually large photospheric spots and other unidentified variables . \n all effects that influence the @xmath69 lightcurve are likely also visible in the mid - ir . \n our fraction of variable objects with a class  iii sed is similar ( 1.8% ) to what wolk et al .  found . in the optical and near - ir , \n the fraction of variable field stars is lower than that value .    _ \n spitzer _ observations of other young clusters also find that younger stars are more variable , but with a lower variability fraction . \n @xcite find only 70% of all stars with disks in their onc sample to have detectable variability . \n @xcite find 60% in ic  348 and @xcite find @xmath84% of all members in ngc  2264 to be variable in the irac bands . \n all three clusters are located at larger distances and thus observations are less sensitive to small variations , the observations of @xcite are more densely sampled and thus provide a better signal . in l1688 , a k5 star with little extinction will have a magnitude of 12.2 in @xmath5 m using the evolutionary tracks of and the yso colors from @xcite . in this magnitude range , \n variability down to 0.05  mag can be detected ( paper  i ) . \n in contrast , for the same star in ic  348 , the variability has to be about twice as large to be detected and three times as large to the detected in the onc . \n of course , even our observations miss the faint end of the distribution . \n thus , it seems likely that essentially all ysos show substantial mid - ir variability on timescales of days to weeks . \n sources with a class  iii sed are not contaminated by disk - bearing stars , since reddening by the cloud can only increase the spectral slope @xmath23 but never hide an existing ir excess \n . the larger fraction of non - member variable objects in the other classes in figure  [ fig : probvarsed ] thus shows that the membership lists are incomplete . \n one caveat here is that the class  iii sources in the sample of members are selected in a different way than the other classes . if true class  iii cluster members with x - ray emission ( that are included in our member sample ) \n are systematically less variable than class  iii members where we do not detect x - ray emission ( that are therefore not included in the member sample ) , that would also lead to a lower observed variability fraction in class  iii member sources . \n however , given the size of the observed effect in variability such a bias seems to be unlikely to be the sole reason for the observed distribution .    the observed probability that a source is variable for all classes of bright non - members ( blue bars ) is consistent with around 5% \n the fact that this barely changes with the sed class , quite unlike the distribution for the cluster members , indicates that unidentified cluster members can not make up a large fraction of the non - member sample since they would bias the observed variability fraction to higher values for the earlier classes . \n the vastly different number of sources in the different bins makes it highly unlikely that each bin is contaminated by the same fraction of class  i - ii cluster members . \n the sample of faint stars has almost the same fraction of variable sources in every sed class . \n the low fraction can be explained by two effects . \n first , variability of faint sources can not be reliably detected unless the amplitude is exceptionally large . \n second , as most cluster members are brighter than 14  mag , the faint sample contains fewer unrecognized cluster members than the sample of brighter sources . \n figure  [ fig : meanampsed ] shows that there is a wide distribution of amplitudes in ysos of class i , f and ii . \n the error bars in this figure represent the standard deviation of the mean amplitudes within one class . \n amplitude and standard deviation in the figure are measured in magnitudes ; a median amplitude of 0.1  mag means that the flux in @xmath33 m varies by 10% for a typical source . for members , \n the variability amplitude is larger in class  i sources than in flat - spectrum and class  ii sources , where the amplitude is still larger than in class  iii sources . \n also , the spread of the amplitudes in class i and f is much larger than for class ii and iii . for non - members , \n the observed amplitudes seem to follow a similar , but less pronounced trend . \n this suggests that the non - member category still includes not only reddened background objects with an intrinsic class  iii sed , but also some unidentified cluster members . \n indeed , we propose that all variable class  i , f and ii sources are members and table  [ tab : newmembers ] lists those new members that are neither contained in our ysovar standard membership set ( see table  [ tab : tab2 ] ) nor in @xcite . \n however , for consistency , we do not modify our sample of members at this point and continue to treat the sources in the table as non - members for the remainder of the analysis . \n two of the objects in the table , and were suggested as a @xmath7  oph substellar candidate members by , the remaining objects have not been studied before .    in summary , \n the probability for any given source to be observed as a mid - ir variable decreases little between class  i and ii sources , but the mean amplitude as well as the differences within a class are much larger for sources which have more circumstellar material . \n cccc 246.88244 & -24.79978 & sstysv j162731.78 -

244029.5 & i +      next , we will look at the timescales of the lightcurves . \n the list of periodic sources contains objects of all evolutionary stages , but is too small to recognize any trends in the period with evolutionary stage . \n we calculate the discrete auto - correlation function @xmath85 for each fast - cadence ( visibility window 1 ) lightcurve to characterise the time - scale in all sources , not just the periodic ones . \n one complication here is that our data are unevenly sampled . in order to calculate the @xmath86 we linearly interpolate the lightcurve on a grid with time steps of 0.1  days . \n this process can change the properties of the lightcurves on short timescales . \n however , for most lightcurves the relevant timescales are longer than the distance between two observations ( 0.1 to 0.8 days ) . \n we use the following definition of the @xmath86 @xmath87 where @xmath53 is the total number of points in the lightcurve @xmath88 with a mean of @xmath61 and a standard deviation of @xmath89 . in the discrete @xmath86 @xmath90 \n is the number of timesteps .    by definition @xmath91 and \n the @xmath86 decays for longer time - lags @xmath90 . \n we take the first value of @xmath90 with @xmath92 as the characteristic time - scale for a lightcurve . \n a more common definition would be to use the position of the first local maximum in the @xmath86 , but due to the low number of datapoints in our lightcurves , the noise in the @xmath86 is large and this value is often not well defined . while our definition might not give us the timescale of the physical processes at work , the @xmath86 timescale still provides relative comparisons . \n we find that the average @xmath86 timescale decreases from 4  days for class i sources to one day for class  iii sources ( figure  [ fig : acf ] ) . \n a more detailed analysis of stochastic and quasi - periodic properties of the lightcurves is beyond the scope of the current paper ( for a discussion of these properties in @xmath70 lightcurves , see * ? ? ? \n the majority of the stars included in our data show no significant variability , and we exclude them from further discussion . \n the remaining stars are definitely variable , with light curve shapes that display a variety of morphologies . \n visual inspection , and some quantitative analysis , allows us to group these stars into sets with similar light curve morphologies - which can be the first step in attaching physical mechanisms as the cause of the observed variability . \n based on a near - ir ( @xmath69 ) monitoring campaign of similar cadence and duration to ours , @xcite identified four light curve morphological classes : ( a ) periodic ; ( b ) quasi - periodic - which they defined as stars with cyclic brightening and fading , but where the frequency and amplitude of the variations varied from cycle to cycle ; ( c ) long - duration - stars with relatively long term monotonic changes in brightness over weeks or months , with eventual changes in sign of the variability ; ( d ) stochastic - which indicated all other variability types , where no obvious pattern to the variability was present .    in another recent paper , \n @xcite analysed a @xmath93 day monitoring campaign for the star - forming region ngc 2264 , using optical data from corot and ir data from irac , to assign light curve morphology classes to their young star set . \n their proposed light curve morphologies were : ( i ) periodic - stars whose light curves show periodic waveforms whose amplitude and shape are unchanging or only change in minor ways over the 30 day observing window . \n these light curves were ascribed generally to cold spots on the stellar photosphere ; ( ii ) dippers - stars showing a well - defined maximum brightness , upon which are superposed flux dips of variable shape and amplitude . \n these are sub - divided into stars where the flux dips occur at an approximately constant period - designated as quasi - periodic systems - and stars with no obvious periodicity to the dips - designated aperiodic . in previous literature , these two sub - classes , or portions of them , have been referred to as aa tau systems and ux ori systems , respectively ; ( iii ) short duration bursters - stars with relatively well - defined minimum light curve levels , superposed on which are brief ( hours to day ) flux increases , attributed to accretion bursts . \n see @xcite for further discussion of this set ; ( iv ) quasi - periodic variables - stars lacking a well - defined maximum brightness but showing periodic variability \n whose waveform changes shape and amplitude from cycle to cycle ; ( v ) stochastic - stars with prominent luminosity changes on a variety of timescales , with no preference for `` up '' or `` down '' . \n ( vi ) long timescale variability - stars with slow ( weeks to months ) changes in brightness .    while there are some clear similarities in the two schemes , their usage of the terms quasi - periodic and stochastic are not the same , and light curves described as belonging to those classes in one scheme would not necessarily be so classified in the other scheme \n . it will be important to resolve these nomenclature issues in the future , perhaps in the same manner as was done for sorting out similar issues on classifying pre - main sequence disk sed morphologies ( evans et al . 2009 ) . in the meantime \n , we must choose which scheme to adopt and be clear that is what we have done . \n for this paper , we adopt the @xcite scheme . \n periodic lightcurves are described in section  [ sect : midirvariability ] and examples can be seen in figure  [ fig : periodlc ] . \n examples of quasi - periodic lightcurves are shown in figure  [ fig : morelcs ] . \n shows variability with a timescale @xmath94  days in the first half of the first visibility window , but around mjd 55316 , the flux increases significantly and this rise masks out any periodicity . the dip around mjd  55325 \n again has a similar duration as those observed in the beginning of the visibility window . \n the other two sources shown might be similar , but the signal - to - noise is not as good . \n other sources are variable , but no preferred timescale for the variability is discernible . and 51 ( figure  [ fig : morelcs2 ] ) are examples of this aperiodic behavior . in yet other cases , the timescale of the variability is so long that we can not decide if a feature is a singular event or part of a recurring pattern . \n good examples of this are wl  4 and , which are shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ] .    in some cases , \n we see short duration features in the lightcurve in addition to a longer trend . \n this can either be a brightening ( e.g.  mjd 55303 and 55311 in , figure  [ fig : morelcs2 ] ) or short dips in the lightcurve that last between one and ten days ( in the same figure ) . \n like @xcite , we find that even strongly periodic sources are not perfect clocks in the mid - ir in that the amplitude can vary from cycle to cycle . \n there might also be phase shifts from visibility window to visibility window . in a very similar study to the one we present here , @xcite observed ic 348 over a 40 day window with irac1 and 2 and find 25% of the variable stars are likely periodic . \n here we find a similar division ; 10 of 52 members are strongly periodic . \n we present the first mid - ir monitoring of l1688 , but the field has been monitored before in the near - ir . \n figure  [ fig : amplitudekvs36 ] compares the @xmath4 band amplitude found in 2mass data taken between 1997 and 2001 @xcite and the @xmath31 band amplitude observed at ukirt between 2005 and 2006 with the amplitude of our @xmath32 m lightcurves . \n given the different bands , it is not surprising that the absolute value of the amplitude differs , but there is a good correlation such that the sources with the largest @xmath31 or @xmath4 band amplitudes in earlier observations also have the largest amplitudes in the irac bands five to ten years later . in most objects , \n color changes are small or happen in parallel with luminosity changes ( section  [ sect : colorchangesandreddening ] ) , so the @xmath31 or @xmath4 band and the [ 3.6 ] variability should be strongly correlated . \n figure  [ fig : amplitudekvs36 ] shows that the amplitude of the variability is relatively stable over at least one decade . \n @xcite used a larger number of observations than and observe a larger spread between a typical yso s brightest and faintest @xmath31-band magnitude , indicating that the longest timescale of variability is longer than the time span of the observations . \n @xcite noted that roughly 6% of the stars in ic  348 had data which indicated significant changes in the source s mid - ir flux over the three year interval since the last irac observation . \n @xcite also displayed numerous examples of stars which showed continuous change over the course of at least one observing visibility window . \n all this shows that the amplitude of variability of a given source may evolve over very long timescales , but is consistent over at least one decade . \n ysos apparently do not switch between highly variable and much less variable states .       of time - variable extinction . \n the largest @xmath95 observed is 1 , but for clearity only the region to @xmath96  mag is shown . \n _ bottom _ : in this panel the length of each line gives the sed class of that object . \n only cluster members have slopes where the source bluens as it fades . \n [ fig : cmdslope],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]   of time - variable extinction . \n the largest @xmath95 observed is 1 , but for clearity only the region to @xmath96  mag is shown . \n _ bottom _ : in this panel the length of each line gives the sed class of that object . \n only cluster members have slopes where the source bluens as it fades . \n [ fig : cmdslope],title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    for sources in the primary target fields , the observations in @xmath5 m and @xmath6 m are separated by only a few minutes . for those sources , \n we compare the color and the magnitude in the @xmath5 m band in a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) ( figures  [ fig : morelcs ] and [ fig : cmd ] ) . in some cases \n , the color is fairly stable within one visibility window , but changes between visibility windows ; in others the timescale of variability is much shorter and color changes are seen within one visibility window as well . for non - variable sources , the cmd forms a point cloud with the size set by the photometric uncertainties , but for variable sources , the shape of the cmd can reveal the physical cause of the variability  for example , if a disk warp or accretion funnel passes in front of a yso , we expect its color to become redder as it becomes fainter . if the absorber has the same gas and dust properties as the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) and absorbs star and inner disk at the same time , then the datapoints in the cmd follow a line with the slope of the interstellar reddening law ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ) .    in each cmd , \n the observational data ( i1 , i1-i2 ) are fit to a line segment using an orthogonal distance regression method that takes the errors in both the x and y directions into account . \n we calculate the length in magnitudes of the line segment excluding the 10% of the data that are outliers on either side . \n the cmd slopes of the 37 sources with a well - defined slope are shown in figure  [ fig : cmdslope ] . \n the x and the y axis in the cmd are correlated , because they both depend on the @xmath5 m magnitude so sources which are noise - dominated would show a slope of @xmath97 . \n no source is seen in this region .    from a total of 42 variable sources with cmds with at least ten datapoints , \n 37 can be fitted with a formal uncertainty on the best fit slope below @xmath98 . in four of the five sources with a statistical error on the slope in the cmd @xmath99 , \n the color variability is dominated by observational uncertainties ; the remaining source iso - oph  140 is discussed below .    as can be seen in figure  [ fig : cmd ] , even in those sources with a well defined slope in the cmd , \n the scatter around the best linear fit is larger than the measurement uncertainties ; individual visibility windows are systematically above or below the fitted line . \n the slopes shown in figure  [ fig : cmdslope ] can be separated ( somewhat arbitrarily ) in two groups . \n one group becomes redder when the sources are fainter with slopes comparable to the ism reddening . \n this group contains almost all variables that are not classified as cluster members in section  [ sect : l1688membership ] . \n most sources in this group have class  i or flat - spectrum seds ( bottom panel ) . \n sources that bluen ( we use the term `` bluen '' as a verb to mean that a source comes bluer similar to the common expressions `` redden '' or `` reddening '' ) when they are fainter are mostly class  ii and flat spectrum sources . figure  [ fig : morelcs ] shows the lightcurves and cmds for two of the bluening sources , and . \n the top panel in figure  [ fig : cmdslope ] quantifies the magnitude of the reddening or bluening observed in each source . for a source \n where the slope in the cmd is compatible with ism reddening , this can be interpreted as the @xmath95 of the intervening material . \n a range of values is observed , but in most sources it is @xmath49  mag . \n no significant difference in vector length is seen between sources that bluen or redden when they dim . \n we discuss the physical mechanisms that could cause these slopes in section  [ sect : scenariosforcolorchanges ] .    comparing the amplitudes of all sources in figure  [ fig : cmdslope ] \n that either redden or bluen over the full time span of the observations , we do not find significant differences in value or distribution of the variability amplitudes . \n similar to our results , find reddening and bluening slopes in the cmd in their @xmath100 monitoring , but compared to figure  [ fig : cmdslope ] they see a higher fraction of stars that bluen as they dim ( 33/49 ) . \n only six sources have well defined slopes in both their study and ours . in the data of , \n all of them belong to the group that bluen with lower fluxes . in five cases , \n our data agree . \n in contrast , roxn  44 reddens in our observations , so its behavior changed over the time interval of five years , or it is behaving differently in the near and mid - ir .      is the only source with a statistical error on the slope in the cmd @xmath99 where the color variability is not dominated by observational uncertainties , but where the slope varies substantially over time . \n its lightcurve and cmd for the first visibility window are shown in figure  [ fig : cmdsquare ] . \n it has a class  ii sed slope and is a low mass yso ( spectral type m1 ; * ? ? ? \n there is no single slope in the cmd ; instead the source seems to switch between different modes . \n initially , the luminosity drops sharply , while the color becomes slightly bluer . the behavior changes around mjd 55305 . for the next 15 days , the source becomes redder and dimmer , but the slope is less steep than the ism reddening law . \n the evolution is not monotonic , but a brightening ( e.g.  around mjd 55313 ) corresponds to a bluer color and the source reddens as it dims . at the end of this period , \n the brightness increases again sharply and the slope in the cmd is comparable to the period mjd 55295 to 55305 : the source becomes noticeably redder with higher luminosity . in the last 10 days of the monitoring , the source again has a slope close to the ism reddening law . \n its luminosity continues to increase and the color bluens until it has a similar color and luminosity as it did at the beginning of the monitoring . \n this closes the circle in the cmd . \n this is the only source in our sample where we observe multiple changes of the reddening slope over time . in this case , \n variability similar to ism reddening corresponds to slow changes in luminosity , while the other direction of the slope in the cmd is associated with faster luminosity changes . \n now we discuss the lightcurves with the largest changes in magnitude in our sample . \n wl  4 , shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ] , has an outburst event consisting of a brightness increase by about 0.6  mag and bluening at the same time . the rise and \n fall take only a few days and the entire outburst lasts about a month . \n [ edj2009 ]  892 ( shown in the same figure ) presents a slow rise by about 0.2  mag in @xmath33 m and smooth decay over two years where the source gradually bluens ( although more activity between visibility windows can not be excluded ) . \n there is an indication of a slow and smooth increase in brightness again in the last observing visibility window , pointing to a recurring phenomenon . \n these timescales are much longer than the dynamical time in the inner disk , so they are presumably driven by disk phenomena that originate at larger radii . \n @xcite identified a few such bursting or fading events in their analysis of ysovar data for the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) and they have also been observed in the optical @xcite . the physical cause is not known yet . \n @xcite find a few lightcurves that match theoretical predictions for short mass accretion events , but without simultaneous spectroscopy this is hard to prove . \n the best example presented here , wl  4 , becomes bluer during the burst , but the opposite happens for wl  3 , which otherwise has a similar lightcurve . \n thus , it is likely that different mechanisms cause these burst events . \n the reddening sources in figure  [ fig : cmdslope ] have slopes that are roughly compatible with the slope of an interstellar reddening law . \n small deviations can be explained by modifications of the dust - to - gas ratio or the grain size and composition . \n this is commonly observed in individual young stars and star forming regions as a whole @xcite . \n the most prominent example of a class  ii source where the extinction changes on timescales of days is . in this case , \n the absorption dip is periodic and caused by an inner disk warp partially occulting the star . \n many examples of comparable lightcurves have been found in the onc by @xcite and in ngc  2264 by @xcite . \n these authors call objects with absorption events in the lightcuve `` dippers '' . \n we observe reddening on timescales of months to years in about half of all sources with a well - defined slope in the cmd . \n an example of that is shown in the top right panel of figure  [ fig : cmd ] . \n we do not know the inclination of the objects in our sample , but if it is close to edge - on , this might be caused by an asymmetric disk similar to aa  tau . \n the required warp or local change in scale height that lets some gas and dust protrude above the average disk height , could be caused by a low - mass star , brown dwarf or planetary mass object orbiting in the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n alternatively , vortices in the disk or dust traps can also change the local scale height . \n changes in the optical brightness and color of a yso are often attributed to spots , either hot accretion spots or cold magnetic spots , rotating in and out of view or to time - variable extinction ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n if the reddening increases and , at the same time , the visible fraction of the hot spot decreases , then the resulting slope in the cmd would be intermediate between ism reddening and colorless . \n since spots on the star can not explain sources that bluen as they dim , this observed phenomenon must be related to the disk . \n several parameters of the inner disk could be time variable . \n the most obvious one is the accretion rate . \n however , the direct effect of increased accretion is a larger accretion spot , which would make the star bluer and brighter , not fainter . \n also , @xcite find no relation between mid - ir lightcurves and spectroscopic accretion tracers in their limited sample . \n this indicates that the relevant parameter can change without affecting the accretion rate . in the mid - ir \n , we see the optically thick dust at the inner disk edge . \n because the disk is heated over its entire vertical height at the inner edge while only the disk surface absorbs radiation at larger radii , it can form a puffed - up inner rim that reaches above the usual disk scale height and casts a shadow on the remaining disk , reducing the luminosity at longer wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n if this rim grows , it intercepts more stellar light . \n thus , the emission from the inner wall increases and the emission from the outer disk decreases , which results in bluer colors . \n since the total emitting area also decreases , the source can become bluer and fainter . \n @xcite also present radiative transfer models with hot spots and warped disks that reproduce features of the observed lightcurves . \n alternatively , @xcite suggested a non - axisymmetric model . if the emission from the stellar photosphere is stronger at some longitudes due to a strong accretion spot or a spot from magnetic activity on the star , it irradiates the inner disk like a searchlight beam and causes the dust at this longitude to retreat . \n the result is a disk where the inner rim is broken at one ( or several ) positions . \n this would reduce the emission in @xmath5 m , but cause more energy to be emitted at a larger radius , where the dust is cooler on average and thus emits at longer wavelengths such as @xmath6 m . in this way \n , the source can become redder as it brightens . \n there is one group of ysos , the so - called ux ori ( uxor ) variables where several members have been observed to bluen when they fade in optical observations . \n this can be explained by a larger fraction of scattered light that contributes to the observed sed in their faint state . \n a similar scenario for the ysos discussed here requires , first , scattering by relatively large grains ( @xmath101  mm ) , because only for large grains radiation at @xmath32 m will be scattered more than radiation at @xmath33 m . \n grains this large will be present in the disk , but not at all radii and all disk heights . \n second , for this mechanism to work , a large fraction of the ir radiation must be scattered light and not intrinsic emission . in contrast \n , many bluening sources are class  i to flat - spectrum sources , where the ir luminosity is comparable to the total stellar irradiation . \n none of the simple models presented so far offers a convincing explanation of the observed lightcurves and cmds . \n however , detailed simulations that take into account turbulent transport processes in the disk and different dust species with a complete chemical network have not yet been performed . \n the real situation is likely to be much more complex than sketched above . since different dust species form and sublimate with different speeds and at different temperatures , \n time variable irradiation can actually cause a very complex mixture of species with different opacities , which will not react linearly to increased irradiation . such a complex network might cause a delayed and non - linear response of the disk , which masks the underlying relation between accretion and disk emission . \n the characteristics of the time variability in the lightcurves could be related to the spectral type of the central star as hotter stars irradiate the disk with harder spectra . \n we compared the 90% quantiles of the observed @xmath6 m magnitudes for those sources in our sample that have spectroscopically determined spectral types from @xcite . \n we use the relation between spectral type and @xmath102 from @xcite . \n this gives values for ten objects in our sample and we do not find a correlation in this set . \n similarly , @xcite do not identify any trends in infarared variability versus effective temperature among few myr old ngc 2264 stars . \n in apparent contrast , @xcite find that the variability in [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] increases with increasing @xmath102 , but they show that this trend probably does not reflect a change in disk properties , but is instead due to the lower relative contribution of the photosphere compared to the disk for hotter stars .      in this section , \n we analyze the subsample of sources with x - ray counterparts . \n since the subsample is not selected for its ir properties , it provides a clean sample to calculate the variability fraction . \n there are 31 sources with detected x - ray emission , of which 20 are variable in the ir . \n again , we find high variability fractions in class  i ( 6/7 ) , f ( 3/4 ) and ii ( 11/15 ) , while none of the four class  iii sources is variable . \n the sample size is small , but this is consistent with our analysis of the ir selected sample in section  [ sect : evolutionarytrendsofthevariability ] . \n we searched for correlations between the parameters of the x - ray emission ( median energy , fitted temperature and absorbing column density ) and the amplitude of the mid - ir variability . \n no such correlation is apparent within each sed class . for a given absorbing column density , \n soft x - ray emission is more strongly absorbed than hard x - ray emission . \n thus , the observed x - ray spectrum from more embedded sources always appears harder . \n since class  ii sources have more circumstellar matter than class  iii sources , it is not surprising that they appear harder . @xcite already discuss this for the l1688 x - ray data ; figure  [ fig : probvarsed ] and [ fig : meanampsed ] show that class  ii sources are more variable than class  iii sources . \n we see no additional effect of the x - ray emission on the variability characteristics in the mid - ir . \n we present _ spitzer _ observations of ysos in the star forming region l1688 . \n observations were taken in four visibility windows in spring and fall of 2010 and 2011 , with about 70 observations in spring 2010 and about ten observations in the remaining visibility windows . \n the cadence of the observations is non - uniform to avoid bias in the period detection . \n our sample consists of 882 sources with lightcurves in irac1 and irac2 with at least 5 datapoints . of those 882 sources , we classify 70 sources as variable using the stetson test , the @xmath22 test and the lomb - scagle periodogram . \n the faintest sources in the sample have @xmath103  mag , but naturally the measurement uncertainties are larger for fainter sources . \n the algorithms detect variability if the amplitude is larger than @xmath104  mag for a source of @xmath105  mag . \n we define a sample of cluster members , including sources with an ir excess due to a circumstellar disk or with x - ray emission . for cluster members \n , there is a clear correlation between evolutionary status and ir variability . \n more embedded sources are more often detected to be variable , and they have on average larger variability amplitudes . \n overall , the data are consistent with the idea that all ysos are variable at @xmath5 m and @xmath6 m , and we thus propose that all variable sources in our sample are members of the l1688 star forming region .    qualitatively different morphological types of lightcurves can be distinguished : 14 lightcurves are detected to be periodic ; beyond that , we find quasi - periodic lightcurves , where the variability has an apparent timescale , but is not regular enough to be detected as periodic ; aperiodic lightcurves without a preferred timescale ; and long - term variable lightcurves where variability is apparent , but no periodicity or time - scale can be determined within the observational window . \n in addition , there are lightcurves with short , non - repeating bursts or dips . \n roughly half of all sources become redder when they are fainter ; the other half becomes bluer . \n the reddening values of the first group are compatible with ism reddenig . \n the color changes in the second group require variability in the inner disk structure as proposed by @xcite or @xcite . \n this work is based on observations made with the spitzer space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under a contract with nasa . \n support for this work was provided by nasa through an award issued by jpl / caltech . \n this research made use of astropy , a community -

Recent advances in dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) have revealed a Mott transition that synthesizes the pictures of Mott and Brinkman-Rice, with the formation of Hubbard bands and a large mass quasiparticle. However, DMFT does not account for variations in quasiparticle properties across the Brillouin zone, which may be important for the antiferromagnetic aspect of the Mott transition. To address this limitation, we extend Potthoff's \"two-site\" approach, which successfully captured the Mott transition physics with a drastic approximation of the non-interacting bath of electrons, to treat cluster DMFT. We apply this method to investigate the approach to the Mott transition for a single-band Hubbard model on a two-dimensional square lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping. Our results are consistent with other results in the literature for the magnetic phase diagram and reveal interesting features in the quasiparticle properties in momentum space, including the evolution of an electron-like metal to a hole-like doped Mott insulator near half-filling. We also observe a Fermi surface distortion resulting from a Pomeranchuk instability. Our method allows us to quickly investigate the zero-temperature phase diagram across a large range of parameter space using a desktop computer, and our results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach.

[ dmftsigma ] ) using : @xmath19    the full functional self - consistency of eq . \n [ dmftsc ] can not be achieved within such a restricted representation so it is necessary to decide how best to implement a self - consistency requirement . \n potthoff chose two physically motivated features , taking advantage of the analytic simplicity of the two - site impurity model . \n firstly , the electron fillings given by the green s functions must be equal for the impurity model and the lattice model . \n secondly , features of the central quasiparticle peak are matched : the self - energy is reduced to the low energy form @xmath20 , and terms of the resulting `` coherent '' impurity and lattice green s functions at high energy are matched ( see ref .   for more detail ) . in effect , the shape of the central quasiparticle peak is analyzed by the size of its high energy tails , isolated from other parts of the spectrum . \n the resulting self - consistency conditions for the four bath parameters ( @xmath21 ) are : @xmath22 where the quasiparticle residue @xmath23 and we have assumed that @xmath24 .    solving these equations produces results for the mott transition which compare well with the full dmft , and properties of the fermi liquid which are consistent with exact results ( see ref .  ) . \n it is hard to imagine a simpler model which can do this ; it succeeds because of the physical motivation of its self - consistency conditions , namely the filling and properties of the quasiparticle peak . \n it is a useful approach for calculations on extended models such as multiple bands  @xcite and , as we shall demonstrate , clusters . \n we now consider an extension of this method to cluster dmft :  @xcite instead of starting with a single site , self - consistency conditions are derived for a cluster of sites , which allows a momentum dependence in the self - energy . \n the geometry of the lattice becomes important and hence different types of magnetic order can be investigated , and spectral information varies non - trivially in @xmath25-space , unlike conventional dmft . \n a number of studies have been reported . \n @xcite we describe here a cluster dmft for the case where the cluster consists of just a pair of sites . \n we then detail how to implement potthoff s two - site method to solve cluster dmft . \n this can be contrasted with the exact diagonalization formulation of conventional dmft ,  @xcite where a single impurity site with multiple bath sites is used ; instead , we use multiple impurity sites in a cluster and include correlations in the simplest way via potthoff s scheme for single bath sites . \n below , we derive the self - consistency conditions for the pair - cluster ( each of the two cluster sites is connected to a single bath site ) . \n implementing a cluster dmft is fundamentally ambiguous , as recently noted by biroli _ \n et al . _ ;  @xcite the approach we adopt is `` cdmft '' within their classification , which is arguably the simplest scheme appropriate for broken symmetry states . \n one of the strengths of conventional dmft is that it is exact in the limit of infinite dimensions . \n in contrast , our cluster approach is not a systematic @xmath26 correction , though it is of course exact in the limit of infinite cluster size when the self - consistent bath is merely a sophisticated boundary condition . \n @xcite    in cluster dmft we imagine integrating out all sites except those in the cluster . \n an electron can in general now leave from and arrive back at any of the sites within the cluster : the function @xmath6 must become a matrix , coupling together the dynamics of the cluster sites . \n the resulting action ( _ c.f . _ eq .  [ dmftseff ] ) is : @xmath27 where the summations are over the cluster sites . solving this local problem \n now yields a matrix @xmath28 and a matrix self - energy . \n different approaches to cluster dmft involve different ways of combining the matrix self - energy with the non - interacting lattice green s function , and different self - consistency conditions . \n we shall now describe our particular approach , for the specific case of a 2d square lattice with a cluster consisting of a pair of sites . \n the sites represent the two sublattices of the bipartite square lattice , and we label them @xmath29 and @xmath30 . \n the impurity model consists of a pair of sites connected by a @xmath31 hopping element , cut out of the original lattice [ see fig .  [ \n impfig](a ) ] . each site has its own independent bath site [ fig . \n [ impfig](b ) ] . \n the hamiltonian for this pair - cluster impurity model is diagonalized as previously , resulting in a @xmath32 matrix green s function , whose self - energy matrix is extracted ( _ c.f . _ eq . \n [ dmftsigmatwosite ] ) using dyson s equation :    @xmath33    where the matrix index is the cluster site @xmath34 . \n the non - interacting lattice green s function now has @xmath25-dependence from the fourier transform of hopping elements to surrounding clusters [ fig . \n [ impfig](c ) ] , and is a matrix with respect to the cluster sites @xmath34 . combining it with the matrix self - energy from the impurity model according to the dmft ansatz , gives the interacting lattice green s function ( as above , _ \n eq .  [ dmftlatgf ] ) : \n full self - consistency would require that the matrix version of eq . \n [ dmftsc ] be satisfied , but here because of the restricted representation of @xmath36 using just two additional non - interacting sites , we must adopt a more modest self - consistency requirement . \n we generalize the approach of ref .   and require firstly that the filling of each sublattice is the same for the impurity and lattice models : @xmath37 which will effectively constrain @xmath38 . \n the second condition characterizes the coherent quasiparticle peak . \n expanding the green s function matrices at high @xmath39 , with the coherent form of the self - energy in place , gives a matrix equation self - consistency equation involving a quasiparticle residue matrix @xmath40 : @xmath41    after the @xmath25-sum has been carried out we obtain the self - consistency condition : @xmath42 this constrains @xmath43 in terms of the quasiparticle residues @xmath44 calculated from the local self - energy . \n we now describe the implementation of our cluster dmft approach . \n the eight self - consistent equations ( eqs  [ clustersc1 ] and  [ clustersc2 ] ) are solved for the eight bath parameters @xmath45 , and additionally we wish to consider a given total filling @xmath46 , and this provides a ninth condition which constrains the chemical potential @xmath47 such that @xmath48 . \n the practical problem is thus nine - dimensional root finding , for which we use a broyden method combined with line searches . \n @xcite    the two main computations are diagonalizing the hamiltonian and calculating the band filling for the lattice case . for the latter , we sum the imaginary part of the lattice green s function ( eq .  [ latgf ] ) over a finite number of points in @xmath25-space and then integrate numerically for @xmath49 . \n a small analytic continuation @xmath50 is required , with @xmath51 , and typically the @xmath25-sum involves @xmath52 points across the brillouin zone ; checks were done to ensure that dependence on @xmath53 and @xmath54 is insignificant . \n fillings above @xmath55 are ignored since the @xmath25-space resolution is insufficient to give an accurate representation of the fermi surface , except at exactly half - filling where this is not an issue .    for each choice of @xmath56 \n there is in general more than one set of bath parameters which satisfies the self - consistency conditions . \n phases with paramagnetic , ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic , ferrimagnetic , insulating and charge - ordered character have all emerged . \n we did not consider superconducting order . \n a pitfall of any self - consistency scheme is the production of unphysical excited states , and an advantage of the two - site dmft is the ease of calculating the energy of a solution . using fetter and walecka , \n @xcite the energy of a fully interacting system is @xmath57,\\ ] ] where @xmath58 ( the non - interacting hamiltonian ) , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are matrices with respect to @xmath34 as above . \n we use this to identify the lowest energy solution .    as well as the energy and magnetic order \n , we wish to access the @xmath25-space spectral information of our solutions . \n combining sublattice green s functions defined in the reduced brillouin zone into a single correlation function where @xmath25 is in the extended ( non - symmetry - broken ) brillouin zone , gives :    @xmath61 \n we apply our cluster dmft approach to the single band hubbard model on a 2d square lattice defined in eq . \n [ hubbardham ] . \n we analyze our results for the region @xmath62 and filling @xmath63 . \n we find a ground state phase diagram with a variety of phases , both magnetic and non - magnetic , as illustrated in fig . \n [ pd1 ] ; the extent of magnetism is much reduced from that predicted by hartree \n fock theory . \n note that all our phases are metallic for @xmath64 and insulating for the half - filled case @xmath65 . from an analysis of the full spectral function \n @xmath66 we can characterize the phases and offer a physical origin for their stability . \n schematic ground state phase diagram @xmath67 for the square lattice hubbard model ( bandwidth @xmath68 ) for our cluster dmft , showing a conventional paramagnetic phase ( a ) , a paramagnetic phase with a distorted fermi surface ( b ) , a slater - like antiferromagnetic phase ( c ) , another antiferromagnetic phase ( d ) , a pure slater nested antiferromagnetic phase ( e ) and a ferromagnetic phase ( f ) . \n a dashed line indicates a second order transition . \n the phases are characterized further in the text . \n solutions for the hatched region , @xmath69 , are not considered ( see text ) . ] \n recall that for this model there are three important factors driving the underlying physics : the mott transition , the nesting of the @xmath15 fermi surface at @xmath65 , and the van hove points in the free particle dispersion at @xmath70 and @xmath71 . \n clearly at @xmath65 all of these factors play a rle , but away from this point we see the three factors exerting distinct influences on the ground state physics . \n the solution far from half - filling ( @xmath72 ) , or for very small interaction strength ( @xmath73 ) , is a metallic paramagnetic phase [ fig . \n [ pd1 ] phase ( a ) ] with a sharply defined fermi surface , seen as a discontinuity in @xmath74 [ fig . \n [ ghost1](b ) , dotted line ] . \n this fermi liquid becomes increasingly correlated as @xmath1 is increased ; the quasiparticle residue @xmath75 decreases , and @xmath74 becomes more homogeneous ( though maintaining a discontinuity ) as weight spreads out through @xmath25-space . \n this reflects the local nature of the strong repulsion , @xmath1 . \n spectrally , hubbard side bands are observed to appear , and the central quasiparticle band narrows ; an example density of states is shown in fig . \n [ dos1 ] , consistent with the three peak structure   used to understand the mott transition . \n @xcite     at @xmath76 , @xmath77 the ground state is paramagnetic [ fig . \n [ pd1 ] ( a ) ] . \n the smoothed local density of states for this solution is shown . \n the central quasiparticle peak shows a single - particle density of states , with a bandwidth @xmath78 significantly renormalized from the original @xmath68 due to correlations . above and below the peak \n there are upper and lower hubbard bands , separated by a mott gap of size @xmath79 , and both hubbard bands show imprints of the single - particle dispersion . ]    as the filling @xmath46 is increased nearer to 1 ( half - filling ) , the fermi surface in the paramagnetic state expands , and we observe a phase transition [ to phase ( b ) of fig .  [ pd1 ] ] where the fermi surface breaks @xmath80-@xmath81 symmetry ( see fig .  [ fs1 ] ) . \n it is likely that the system is exploiting the reduced fermi velocity near the van hove point @xmath71 to redistribute electrons in momentum space to lower the total energy  a pomeranchuk transition . \n this tendency has also been seen by other authors . \n @xcite note however , our cluster breaks @xmath80-@xmath81 symmetry from the outset , so this is not strictly symmetry breaking , but the degree of deviation from @xmath80-@xmath81 symmetry increases abruptly at this point .     at @xmath82 , @xmath83 the ground state is paramagnetic but the fermi surface has spontaneously distorted [ fig .  [ pd1 ] phase ( b ) ] . \n here the electron filling @xmath74 is shown in grayscale across the brillouin zone : black corresponds to fully occupied states , white are completely empty states . \n the fermi surface is well defined , but has undergone a pomeranchuk transition : electrons have moved from @xmath70 to @xmath71 , exploiting the flat dispersion near the van hove point . note the appearance of a faint `` ghost '' fermi surface displaced from the original by a wavevector @xmath84 . \n this is due to the effect of antiferromagnetic fluctuations . ]    for @xmath85 and @xmath86 , we find that the ground state is a spin - symmetry - broken antiferromagnetic phase [ fig . \n [ pd1 ] phase ( c ) ] . \n the fermi surface is pomeranchuk distorted , remaining the same shape as for the paramagnet [ fig . \n [ pd1 ] phase ( b ) ] . \n the local density of states shown in fig . \n [ dos2](a ) changes little between that paramagnetic and this magnetically ordered state . \n indeed , the only change is that @xmath87 becomes no longer equal to @xmath88 . \n we interpret this phase as a slater antiferromagnet because the density of states and quasiparticle dispersion is , for low @xmath1 at least , what one would expect from a weak spin - density wave transition on a metallic state with a gap growing like @xmath1 ( see , for example , the mean - field theory of schrieffer , wen and zhang  @xcite ) . \n note that here the gap in the density of states is already present in the paramagnetic state ; we will refer back to this point in relation to the pseudogap physics of the cuprates .     at @xmath89 , \n @xmath90 the ground state is an antiferromagnetic metal with a distorted fermi surface [ fig . \n [ pd1 ] phase ( c ) ] . \n ( a ) the total local density of states is shown for this state ( smoothed and combining up and down spins ) . \n the magnetic gap is apparent , and correlations cause further partitioning . in this region the gap size increases with increasing @xmath1 . \n the densities of states for the neighboring paramagnetic solution [ fig . \n [ pd1 ] phase ( b ) ] are insignificantly different , although the sublattice- and spin - resolved densities of states are of course unbalanced for antiferromagnetic solutions . \n ( b ) the evolution of the electron spectral function is shown for various straight - line sections through the brillouin zone . \n the plot is grayscale with darker regions representing states with higher spectral weight . as well as weakly dispersing bands at high energies \n , the quasiparticle dispersion can be seen for energies between @xmath91 . \n the form of the dispersion is that expected for a mean field spin - density wave state . \n hence we identify the gap in the density of states as being slater - like . ] \n there is a second antiferromagnetic phase [ fig . \n [ pd1 ] phase ( d ) ] which appears when @xmath92 . here \n the magnetic gap develops within the narrow quasiparticle peak of the density of states , which is itself well separated from two fully formed hubbard bands in the familiar three peak structure ( see fig . \n [ dos3 ] ) . \n the momentum dependence of the narrow quasiparticle dispersion has the same structural form as that in the slater magnetic phase above but with a greatly reduced bandwidth . \n this can be seen by comparing the spectral functions shown in fig . \n [ dos2](b ) and fig . \n [ dos3](b ) near @xmath93 . \n the magnetism is thus appearing like a spin - density wave transition but now for the renormalized quasiparticles . \n we find that the gap reduces as @xmath1 is increased consistent with @xmath94 ; thus we interpret this phase as an antiferromagnetic metal in an effective @xmath2-@xmath95 model , where @xmath96 and @xmath97 . \n the neighboring paramagnetic phase ( at a reduced filling of @xmath98 ) could perhaps be described , at low energies , as a nearly - antiferromagnetic fermi liquid .     at @xmath76 , \n @xmath99 the ground state is also an antiferromagnetic metal with little @xmath100 symmetry breaking [ fig . \n [ pd1 ] phase ( d ) ] . \n ( a ) here we show the local density of states ( smoothed , up and down spins combined ) . \n the central quasiparticle peak is separated from upper and lower hubbard bands and is heavily renormalized due to correlations . \n it is also gapped ; this gap decreases with increasing @xmath1 . \n ( b ) from the spectral density we identify the dispersing quasiparticle near the chemical potential . \n the form of the dispersion is very similar to that of fig . \n [ dos2](b ) , so slater - like , but the degree of dispersion is very much reduced . ] \n there are two other magnetic phases . \n first , exactly at half - filling ( and extending to lower @xmath46 near @xmath101 ) there is a antiferromagnet [ fig . \n [ pd1 ] phase ( e ) ] of fairly pure slater character , inevitable for a bipartite lattice . \n the spectrum we find is consistent with that described elsewhere in the literature , for example the separate high energy bands in ref .  . \n second , there is a small patch of low moment ferromagnetism [ fig . \n [ pd1 ] phase ( f ) ] ; here the system is exploiting the soft fermi surface near the van hove points ( _ c.f . _ \n ref .  ) , and the fermi surface for one spin species distorts more than the other .      a key puzzle in the study of correlated electrons near the mott transition concerns the changes in the fermi surface as the mott insulating state is approached . \n how , for example , does the large volume fermi surface expected in a fermi liquid obeying luttinger s theorem , evolve into a doped mott insulator where it appears that the number of holes characterizes physical properties ( see , for example , ref .  ) ? \n this question can be answered within the constraints of our approach : as the carrier concentration approaches half - filling , we see a large fermi surface breaking up into hole pockets separated by regions without free carriers . in this section \n we will describe this process in more detail . \n well away from half - filling , we observe a distinct fermi surface , defined by a discontinuity in @xmath102 [ see dotted line in fig . \n [ ghost1](b ) ] , with a luttinger volume equal to @xmath46 . \n as @xmath103 and we approach an antiferromagnetic state , evidence of a `` ghost '' fermi surface is seen : low energy electron - like excitations appear at the position of the original fermi surface but displaced by the antiferromagnetic wavevector @xmath104 . \n this can be seen as a faint line in fig . \n note that the magnetic symmetry has not yet been broken . \n looking at the complete spectrum [ for example in figs  [ ghost1](c ) and \n ( d ) ] reveals that this `` ghost '' fermi surface is a manifestation of a `` ghost dispersion''the original dispersion shifted by @xmath104 . \n this ghost dispersion has much less spectral weight than the original renormalized quasiparticle dispersion . \n nevertheless , it hybridizes with the original dispersion to give the final electronic structure . \n the hybridization opens a gap in the dispersion , and the effects of the gap depend on whether the chemical potential @xmath47 falls within the gap , and how the gap evolves round the brillouin zone . \n a schematic view of the origin of the electronic structure is given in fig . \n [ ghostsch ] .     a schematic view of the origin of the structure of the electron spectral function in the pseudogap region [ as seen within our approach in figs  [ ghost1](c ) and  ( d ) ] . \n darker lines carry more spectral weight . \n ( a ) distinct fluctuations on the @xmath29 and @xmath30 sublattices result in a second dispersion of low weight ( a `` ghost '' dispersion ) . \n this is formed by the folding of the original , possibly renormalized , dispersion in the antiferromagnetic brillouin zone ( defining @xmath105 ) . \n ( b ) this hybridizes with the original dispersion and forms a gap . along directions in momentum space where the chemical potential lies in the gap [ line(i ) ] , there is a gap in the excitation spectrum and no fermi surface . along directions where the chemical potential lies away from the gap it crosses the dispersion at two points [ line ( ii ) ] . \n a hole pocket forms with low spectral weight at the second crossing . ]    in the case of fig . \n [ fs1 ] where @xmath82 and @xmath83 , @xmath47 is below the gap everywhere on the fermi surface , and crosses the new dispersion in two places ; the spectral weight at the second crossing is much weaker and causes the `` ghost '' fermi surface . \n however , if the filling is increased ( raising @xmath47 ) or the interaction @xmath1 is increased , widening the hybridization gap , then the chemical potential may fall within the gap at various places around the brillouin zone . \n such an occurrence is illustrated in fig . \n [ ghost1](d ) for the case ( @xmath106 , @xmath83 ) along the line in the brillouin zone ( 0,0 ) to ( @xmath107 ) . with no band crossing the fermi surface \n there is no discontinuity in @xmath108 as demonstrated in fig . \n [ ghost1](b ) . \n instead @xmath108 falls smoothly because of the reduced spectral weight in the `` ghost '' band that forms at the high momentum end of the low energy dispersion . \n there is a gap for single electron excitations along this direction . \n this gap is a pseudogap rather than a complete gap as there are other directions where a well - defined fermi - surface remains . \n fig  [ ghost1](c ) shows the spectral function along the line ( 0,0 ) to ( @xmath109,0 ) . \n there the chemical potential crosses the spectral function dispersion in two places . \n the spectral weight is much weaker at the higher momentum crossing because this part of the dispersion derives mainly from the `` ghost '' band . \n these two crossings mark the edges of a hole pocket as can be seen in fig . \n [ ghost1](a ) . \n the quasiparticles have developed hole - like characteristics and the luttinger volume has changed . \n however , because of the evolving spectral weight in momentum space , only one side of the pocket has quasiparticles with high electron weight . \n these hole pockets could resemble disconnected fermi surface arcs to experimental probes unable to resolve the small electron weight at the second dispersion crossing . \n a similar breakup of the fermi surface near the mott transition was suggested by furakawa _ \n et al . _ \n @xcite    as @xmath46 increases , the hole pockets reduce in size until they become points , and subsequently vanish and the system is an insulator . \n this illustrates how a smooth metal - insulator transition is possible . \n after a pseudogap has formed , the luttinger volume can not be defined as usual ; the active fermi surface consists of hole pockets , and rest of the filled region of @xmath25-space is bounded by portions of the original fermi surface where @xmath74 falls smoothly , without a step . \n the features described above are reminiscent of the cuprate high - temperature superconductors in their normal state , which are believed to have a fermi surface consisting of arc - like segments separated by pseudogap regions ( see for example refs  ) . a picture where the dispersion relation hybridizes with a `` ghost '' dispersion is consistent with angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments ( see for example fig .  58 of ref .  ) , and also emerges from other theoretical models.@xcite    there are important differences , however , between our results and what is seen in the cuprates , most significantly in the position of the arcs and the pseudogap regions . in the cuprates \n the fermi surface arcs are seen at @xmath110 but appear near @xmath111 in our calculations , and the pseudogap occurs near @xmath70 in the cuprates but near @xmath110 in our calculations . \n however , our results are not incompatible , as restriction to a cluster with only a pair of sites severely constrains the momentum dependence of the electron self - energy . \n fermi surface shapes can only be formed from the original dispersion @xmath112 in combination with the asymmetric dispersion @xmath113 ( as eq . \n [ qpgf ] shows ) . \n this does not admit the @xmath114-wave symmetry observed in the cuprates but only @xmath115- and @xmath116-wave configurations , which means for example that arcing can only happen near the van hove points such as @xmath70 . \n adding more sites to the cluster would progressively optimize our approximation to the real shape , and we intend to extend our work to a four site ( @xmath32 ) cluster which would permit @xmath114-wave symmetry , though at the price of greater numerical complexity . \n we have presented the zero temperature properties of a cluster - type extension of dynamical mean - field theory , where the self - consistency equations have been solved in a very restricted basis . \n our approach allows us to calculate the full phase diagram of a fully interacting system , and it can be surveyed and understood through access to complete spectral information . \n the basis we chose is `` two - site dmft '' , whose results compare favorably with other theories and experiment ; our cluster extension additionally allows a limited momentum dependence of the self - energy . \n our results provide clues to several puzzling features of the metal \n insulator transition and how antiferromagnetism , proximity to van hove points , and formation of the mott gap compete with one another ; all play a rle in various regimes . \n the van hove point causes fermi surface distortions even at low @xmath1 ; nesting causes slater antiferromagnetism near half - filling ; and the mott gap becomes significant at high @xmath1 as one might have anticipated . \n in addition , we see how @xmath2-@xmath95 model physics manifests itself at large @xmath1 via the small magnetic gap . \n we also see how , as the metal  insulator transition is approached \n , the fermi surface evolves from a renormalized fermi liquid obeying luttinger s theorem , to a pseudogap state where a gap opens on some parts of the fermi surface breaking it up into hole pockets ( with a strongly momentum - dependent spectral density ) . \n our work is easily extensible to more sophisticated cluster dmft schemes or multiple bands , and we intend to study a @xmath32 cluster which allows tetragonal symmetry and would compare more directly with the cuprates .", "human_aspect": "{\n  \"background\": \"we present a cluster dynamical mean - field treatment of the hubbard model on a square lattice to study the evolution of magnetism and quasiparticle properties as the electron filling and interaction strength are varied.\",\n  \"method\": \"our approach for solving the dynamical mean - field equations is an extension of potthoff s `` two - site '' method [ phys . rev . b. * 64 *, 165114 ( 2001 ) ] where the self - consistent bath is represented by a highly restricted set of states.\",\n  \"result\": \"as well as the expected antiferromagnetism close to half - filling, we observe distortions of the fermi surface. the proximity of a van hove point and the incipient antiferromagnetism lead to the evolution from an electron - like fermi surface away from the mott transition, to a hole - like one near half - filling. our results also show a gap opening anisotropically around the fermi surface close to the mott transition ( reminiscent of the pseudogap phenomenon seen in the cuprate high-@xmath0 superconductors ).\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"this leaves fermi arcs which are closed into pockets by lines with very small quasiparticle residue.\"\n}", "gpt35_aspect": "{\n  \"background\": \"The article discusses the physics of the Hubbard model, which is important in understanding strongly correlated systems.

moriya interaction . \n two setups with longitudinal and transverse driving are considered , figs . \n [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , respectively . \n the driving is generated by a locally applied oscillating magnetic field , that is , a radio frequency ( rf ) field . \n it is applied only within a narrow strip of width @xmath12 nm that is either located on the left - hand side of the sample for longitudinal driving or at the top of the nanowire for transversal driving . \n we consider a rf field @xmath13 with amplitude @xmath14 mt and frequency @xmath15 ghz . \n it possesses a longitudinal polarization with @xmath16 for fig . \n [ fig1 ] and @xmath17 for fig . \n more details on the simulation and material parameters are given in appendix  [ sec : methods_1 ] . \n we first discuss the situation of _ longitudinal driving_. figure  [ fig1](a1 ) shows the case of a square - shaped thin film where @xmath18 nm at time @xmath19 . \n the panels ( a2)-(a4 ) show snapshots at later times after the driving field has been switched on . \n the rf field at the left edge produces spin waves traveling towards the right , along the length direction of the sample . since the magnetic skyrmion is far away from the sample edges , we observe a nearly pure skew scattering between the propagating spin wave and the magnetic skyrmion , which is in good agreement with that reported in ref .  . \n indeed , the spin wave - skyrmion scattering leads to a backwards motion of the magnetic skyrmion . \n it can be seen that the magnetic skyrmion basically moves against the propagation direction of the spin wave , and reaches the left edge in a finite time . \n in addition , the skyrmion gets slightly dragged towards the upper edge . \n the width in figs . \n [ fig1](a ) is sufficiently large so that the skyrmion reaches the magnon source before it touches the upper edge of the wire . \n the situation changes when the track is narrower . in figs . \n [ fig1](b ) the width is @xmath20 nm and the skyrmion still has not reached the upper edge at a time @xmath21 ns . \n however , for even narrower wires with @xmath22 nm and @xmath23 nm , see figs . \n [ fig1](c ) and [ fig1](d ) , it reaches the edge after a short time . \n close to the edge , the skyrmion changes the direction of its motion . instead of approaching the driving layer , \n the skyrmion moves along the edge away from it . \n this evading motion along the edge is also much faster than the attractive motion towards the magnon source .        for the _ transverse driving _ we observe similar effects . \n the rf field is applied on the upper edge of the nanowire , see fig . \n [ fig2 ] , in the same wire geometries as for the parallel driving . due to the oscillating magnetic field , magnons are excited and propagate downwards along the @xmath24-direction . \n the interaction with magnons pushes the skyrmion towards the upper edge of the wire with a slight side - shift to the right - hand side . \n this can be particularly well seen for the wide wire in figs . \n [ fig2](a ) . \n this setup is however too wide to observe the effects from the sample edge within the simulated time span . \n in contrast to the longitudinal driving mechanism , the skyrmion is now driven faster towards the upper edge , which becomes apparent for the narrower wires shown in figs . \n [ fig1](b)-(d ) . \n when the skyrmion arrives at the edge , it speeds up dramatically and moves along the upper edge towards the right - hand side . \n it reaches the end of the wire in a much shorter time than for longitudinal driving .    , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 for both plots and @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the parallel driving ( a ) and @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the transverse driving ( b ) . \n , scaledwidth=47.0% ]    , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 for both plots and @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the parallel driving ( a ) and @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the transverse driving ( b ) . \n , scaledwidth=47.0% ]      the skyrmion trajectories observed by our micromagetic simulation can be understood in the framework of an effective thiele equation of motion for the skyrmion  @xcite . within this description , \n the skyrmion coordinate @xmath33 is governed by the equation @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the gyrocoupling vector with @xmath36 , which is related to the topological winding number of the skyrmion , @xmath3 is the gilbert damping , and @xmath37 the dissipative tensor which can be approximated to be diagonal , @xmath38 . \n the force on the right - hand side is attributed to the magnon driving and the edge of the sample , @xmath39 . \n close to the edge , the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction leads to a twist of the magnetization  @xcite that acts as a repulsive potential for the skyrmion  @xcite . to a good approximation , \n this potential falls off exponentially with the distance to the edge  @xcite . \n we thus describe the repulsive force by the edges of a nanostrip of width @xmath40 by a superposition of edges at positions @xmath41 and @xmath42 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 parametrizes the strength of the potential and @xmath45 the penetration depth of the magnetization twist . \n the momentum - transfer from the magnon current to the skyrmion also results in a force , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the two - dimensional magnon - current density , and @xmath48 is the wavevector of the spin wave with @xmath49 and @xmath50 . it was shown in refs . \n @xcite that the force is determined by the two - dimensional transport scattering cross section of the skyrmion , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , longitudinal and transverse to the flow direction @xmath53 of the magnon current \n . in general , they depend in a non - trivial manner on the magnon frequency . in the high - frequency limit or , \n equivalently , for large magnon wavevectors @xmath54 @xcite , the transversal transport scattering cross section is universal @xmath55 and @xmath56 so that @xmath57 . \n we also accounted for the decay of the magnon current on a length scale set by the gilbert damping , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the magnon mass and @xmath60 is the frequency of the wave . \n the solution of the thiele equation is plotted in fig . \n [ fig3 ] for some set of parameters . for longitudinal \n driving in panel ( a ) , the wire can be divided into two different areas . \n the skyrmion trajectories belonging to the red shaded area , on the one hand , will end up at the driving layer ( red line ) . \n when the skyrmion starts within the blue shaded area , on the other hand , it will be driven away from the driving layer . \n the interplay between the magnon and edge forces dominates the motion . \n as the magnon current decays exponentially on the length scale @xmath61 with increasing distance to the driving layer , the magnon force that keeps the skyrmion close to the edge also decays so that eventually the skyrmion slowly approaches the center of the wire . \n the red and blue shaded areas are separated by a critical skyrmion trajectory ( white line ) . in any case \n , the longitudinal driving setup will not produce a steady state .    in case of transversal driving in fig . \n [ fig3](b ) , a skyrmion initially positioned at the center of the wire gets attracted towards the driving layer at the top of the wire . at the same time , it gets repelled by the edge twist of the magnetization and if the driving is not too strong the skyrmion reaches a steady state with @xmath62 and a constant velocity , @xmath63 , along the edge . within the thiele approximation , \n this saturated velocity is given by @xmath64 it depends on the steady state distance to the edge , @xmath8 , which is in turn governed by the driving amplitude @xmath0 . \n the last equation applies in the high - frequency limit @xmath55 and , in addition , @xmath65 . in the limit of a small driving amplitude @xmath66 \n , the current @xmath0 will obey fermi s golden rule @xmath67 . in this case , the saturated velocity will scale as @xmath68 .          in order to study the dependence of the skyrmion motion on the gilbert damping parameter @xmath3 , we performed further simulations with a long and narrow wire with @xmath69 nm and @xmath70 nm for various values of @xmath3 in the range from @xmath71 to @xmath72 . \n we consider two amplitudes for the excitation field @xmath73 mt and @xmath14 mt with a frequency @xmath74 ghz . \n the results are shown in fig . \n all setups share the common property , that the skyrmion moves faster and also further if the damping is lower . \n the exact dependence on the damping is , however , very different for longitudinal and transverse driving .    for longitudinal driving in fig . \n [ fig4](a ) , the skyrmion started within the blue shaded area of fig . \n [ fig3](a ) so that its motion is eventually along the edge of the wire . \n the distance travelled after a time of @xmath75 ns for a driving amplitude @xmath14 mt decreases approximately exponentially with increasing @xmath3 . while for the lowest simulated damping , @xmath25 \n , the skyrmion travels @xmath76 nm , it travels only half as far ( @xmath77 nm ) if the damping is doubled to @xmath78 . \n if we increase the damping further by another @xmath79 , the travelled distance again decreases by a factor @xmath80 to only @xmath81 nm . at even larger damping , @xmath82 , the skyrmion moves @xmath83 nm . the corresponding components of the velocity along the track , @xmath84 , are shown in fig . \n [ fig4](b ) . \n the period of acceleration lasts approximately @xmath85 ns for low damping , @xmath25 , and becomes shorter with increasing damping . \n after the peak velocity is reached , the skyrmion decelerates again \n . this peak velocity can be up to @xmath86 m s@xmath87 for @xmath25 , while it is only @xmath88 m s@xmath87 for @xmath78 and @xmath89 m s@xmath87 for @xmath90 . \n if we lower the rf field amplitude down to @xmath73 mt , see fig . \n [ fig4](c ) , the overall shape of the velocity curves stays the same but the time axis rescales with a factor @xmath91 while the value of the velocity rescales by @xmath92 . the highest velocity , at @xmath25 , is now only @xmath93 m s@xmath87 and already @xmath94 m s@xmath87 for @xmath90 . for @xmath95 the motion is almost immediately damped out . \n for transverse driving in fig . \n [ fig4](d ) , the skyrmion moves much faster and further as compared to longitudinal driving . for low damping @xmath25 \n , the skyrmion travels @xmath96 nm to be compared with @xmath76 nm for longitudinal driving . for large damping @xmath82 \n the skyrmion still travels @xmath97 nm . \n a closer look at the corresponding velocity , see fig . \n [ fig4](e ) , reveals that after an acceleration time of @xmath91 ns the skyrmion velocity reaches a steady state . \n for all simulated damping constants , @xmath98 $ ] , the saturated velocities , @xmath63 , are in the regime of @xmath99 up to @xmath100 m s@xmath87 for @xmath14 mt , which is only comparable to the peak velocity at lowest damping for longitudinal driving . \n the dependence of @xmath63 on the gilbert damping becomes much more pronounced for smaller driving amplitude @xmath73 mt as shown in fig . \n [ fig4](f ) .       of a skyrmion in a nanostrip as a function of the scaling variable @xmath101 where @xmath66 is \n the driving amplitude and @xmath3 is the gilbert damping . \n results from micromagnetic simulations for transverse driving . \n the stimulating field @xmath102 ranges from @xmath103 to @xmath104 mt and the frequency is fixed to @xmath74 ghz . \n dimensions of the strip are @xmath105 nm @xmath106 @xmath107 nm @xmath106 @xmath10 nm . the saturation velocity @xmath63 is measured when the skyrmion velocity is converged . \n the inset shows a close -

[ fig6](a ) the saturated velocity @xmath63 versus the driving amplitude @xmath66 at a fixed damping @xmath115 . \n depending on the strength of @xmath66 , we can distinguish four different scenarios a to d. snapshots of the skyrmion corresponding to these scenarios are shown in panel ( b ) . \n the shaded area at the top corresponds to the strip where the oscillating driving field is applied . \n the scenarios are characterized as follows . \n scenario a ( green region ) corresponds to lowest driving fields . in the range from @xmath116 up to @xmath117 mt , the saturated velocity @xmath63 first increases with @xmath110 as predicted from the thiele approximation and then turns to a less steep increase . in this regime , \n the skyrmion smoothly moves along the nanotrack , and does not suffer any significant deformations . \n moreover , only a minor fraction of the skyrmion area has entered the region where the oscillating rf field is applied , see fig . \n [ fig6](b - a ) . \n scenario b ( blue region ) is the intermediate regime between @xmath118 and @xmath119 mt . here \n , the saturated velocity still increases with the amplitude of the stimulating rf field but the increase is less steep than in scenario a. this is related to a power loss from the emission of additional spin waves by the skyrmion , which can be discerned in our simulations . \n scenario c ( yellow region ) is obtained in the range from @xmath120 up to @xmath104 mt which is the highest accessible driving amplitude . in this regime the saturated velocity suddenly drops to a lower value . \n we can associate this sudden drop with the excitation of the internal breathing mode of the skyrmion . as can be seen in fig . \n [ fig6](b - c ) , a sizeable fraction of the skyrmion is located within the area of the applied rf field , which facilitates the excitation of internal modes . \n scenario d ( red region ) is the regime where the drive is so strong that the skyrmion will be destroyed shortly after the rf field is applied . in this limit , \n @xmath121 mt , the skyrmion is driven so hard towards the edge that it is eventually pushed over the edge barrier . \n the topologically non - trivial skyrmion then unwinds and disappears . a snapshot of the destruction process is shown in fig .  [ fig6](b - d ) . \n we studied in depth the motion of an isolated magnetic skyrmion in a nanotrack driven by a magnonic spin - transfer torque provided by a spin wave . \n we considered two setups where spin waves are excited either longitudinal or transverse to the nanotrack . \n we find that the longitudinal driving is less efficient partly due to the damping of the spin waves .    for transverse driving , \n the skyrmion motion attains a steady - state with constant velocity along the track . \n we analyzed the saturated velocity , @xmath63 , as a function of the gilbert damping @xmath3 and the driving amplitude @xmath102 of the magnetic field that generates the spin waves . \n it obeys for low driving the scaling relation @xmath122 where the magnon current amplitude @xmath123 . \n the enhancement of the skyrmion velocity by the factor @xmath124 is comparable to previous results obtained for the skyrmion motion in confined geometries but driven by electronic spin currents  @xcite .    for large transverse driving , \n the skyrmion is pushed into the driving layer and additional magnon modes and even the internal breathing mode of the skyrmion get excited . \n this limits a further increase of the skyrmion velocity and , finally , results in a destruction of the skyrmion . \n our study demonstrates that the position of a skyrmion can be efficiently manipulated by the magnonic spin - transfer torque , and it elucidates the principle of a magnon - driven skyrmion motion which might be of interest for practical applications . \n x.z . was supported by jsps ronpaku ( dissertation ph.d . ) \n j.m . thanks deutsche telekom stiftung , bonn -

potential , @xmath10 , determined by an exponent @xmath11 governing the rigidity of the particles ( see below ) . \n a small energy threshold @xmath12 is introduced in order to drive the particle in a certain direction @xmath13 as indicated in fig . \n [ volumea ] . a small displacement @xmath14 of particle @xmath15 along the @xmath16 direction results in an increase of energy @xmath17 between particles @xmath15 and its neighbors :    @xmath18    where the sum is taken over all the neighbors of particle @xmath15 . \n the soft pair potential @xmath10 can be any repulsive function provided it approaches the hard sphere limit when the control parameter @xmath19 , implying @xmath20 [ a possible function is simply @xmath21 , the case @xmath22 corresponds to the hertz potential ] . \n this condition implies that    @xmath23    and therefore from eq . \n ( [ e ] ) , we obtain : @xmath24    we define the available volume to a grain , @xmath25 , under the energy threshold @xmath12 as : @xmath26 ds,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the dimension of the system , @xmath28 is an infinitesimal solid angle in @xmath27 dimensions , and the available volume @xmath25 is averaged over all the directions of the @xmath27 dimensional solid angle . \n the integration over @xmath29 can be simplified when @xmath30 since for a fixed direction @xmath16 we have :    @xmath31 & \\\\ \n = \\lim_{\\alpha\\rightarrow\\infty } \\int_0^\\infty \\theta[\\epsilon - f_\\alpha(\\max_{\\s\\cdot\\drij > 0}(\\s\\cdot&\\drij)\\dr ) ] \\dr^{d-1 } d[\\dr ] \\\\ \n \\propto & \\min_{\\s\\cdot\\drij > 0}(\\s\\cdot\\drij)^{-d}. \\end{split}\\ ] ]    thus , we obtain :    @xmath32    equation ( [ va ] ) can be interpreted as follows : for each direction @xmath16 , the available volume is determined by the particle position whose projection of the distance to particle @xmath15 in the @xmath16 direction is minimal . \n the total volume is then the average over all directions @xmath16 . \n the proportionality constant in eq . \n ( [ va ] ) can be determined because @xmath25 is equal to the volume of the grains , @xmath33 , when the coordination number @xmath34 , suggesting that , in this limit , @xmath35 for any @xmath16 . \n that is , @xmath36    for mono - disperse spherical particles , @xmath37 . \n thus , we have @xmath38 where we have replaced @xmath39 for nearest neighbors in the last equation . \n this allows us to generalize the volume formula to satisfy additivity and relate it to the voronoi volume as shown below . \n equation ( [ vi ] ) is not additive , and is different from the voronoi volume since only contacting particles are considered in the calculation . strictly speaking , only at the limit when the coordination number @xmath34 , and all the geometrical constraints come from contacting particles , the volume function eq . \n ( [ vi ] ) converges to the voronoi volume . \n however , the formula becomes additive when considering all particles rather than the nearest neighbors in the calculation of the minimum integrand in eq . \n ( [ vi ] ) . \n this approach is justified since non - contact particles may contribute to the energy of deformation in eq . \n ( [ energy ] ) . \n further , if the minimum in eq . \n ( [ vi ] ) is taken over all the particles in the packing , @xmath25 is exactly equal to the voronoi volume , which is obviously additive . in turn \n we provide a formula for the calculation of the voronoi volume in terms of particle positions , as shown next . \n first , we recall the definition of a voronoi cell as a convex polygon whose interior consists of all points which are closer to a given particle than to any other .    formally , the volume of the voronoi cell of particle @xmath15 can be calculated as ( see fig . [ volumeb ] ) : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the distance from particle @xmath15 to the boundary of its voronoi cell in the @xmath16 direction . \n note that this definition is valid whether the particle @xmath42 is in contact with @xmath15 or not . \n if we denote the distance from particle @xmath15 to any particle @xmath42 at @xmath16 direction as @xmath43 then @xmath41 is the minimum of @xmath44 over all the particles @xmath42 for any @xmath45 ( see fig . \n [ volumeb ] ) . \n this leads to    @xmath46    substituting into eq . \n ( [ vor0 ] ) , we prove that the voronoi volume is indeed the volume available per particle as calculated in eq . \n ( [ vi ] ) : @xmath47    formula ( [ vor1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath48 where we define the orientational volume for the @xmath15 particle in the @xmath16 direction as : @xmath49    let us recapitulate and recall the three volumes defined so far which are interrelated : the voronoi and the available volume which satisfy @xmath50 , and the orientational volume which satisfies @xmath51 . \n all the quantities are additive , thus they provide the total volume of the system : @xmath52 for isotropic packings , @xmath53 ( without the average over @xmath16 ) is also additive since the choice of orientation @xmath16 is arbitrary . \n thus , we obtain : @xmath54 this property reduces the calculations , since there is no need for an orientational average . \n we define the orientational free volume function as :    @xmath55    and the reduced orientational free volume function @xmath56 with its average value , @xmath57 , over the particles , @xmath15 , for isotropic systems as :    @xmath58    this average orientational volume function requires only averaging over the particles @xmath15 but not over @xmath16 . \n the more general form of eq . ( [ vor1 ] ) allows study of anisotropic systems , a case left to future work . \n we notice that the average of the orientational volume over the particles ( for a fixed @xmath16 ) is equal to the average of the voronoi volume over the particles : @xmath59 .    the relevance of eq . \n ( [ vor1 ] ) is that :    _ ( i ) _ it provides a formula for the voronoi volume for any dimension in terms of particle positions @xmath7 . \n _ ( ii ) _ it suggests that the voronoi volume is the volume function of the system since it is indeed @xmath25 as calculated from an independent point of view .    _ ( iii ) _ it allows for the calculation of macroscopic observables via statistical mechanics \n . however , further analytical developments are difficult since :    _ ( i ) _ the volume function is a complicated non - local , not pair - wise function of the coordinates .    _ \n ( ii ) _ it requires the use of field - theoretical methods .    _ \n ( iii ) _ it can not be factorized into a single particle partition function , implying that there are intrinsic strong correlations in the system . \n such correlations are implicit in the global minimization in eq . \n ( [ vor1 ] ) which , in practice , is restricted to a few coordination shells and defines a mesoscopic voronoi length scale , which will be of use below . to circumvent the above difficulties , we present a theory of volume fluctuations to coarse grain @xmath60 over this mesoscopic length scale . \n this coarsening reduces the degrees of freedom to one variable , the coordination number of the grains , and calculates the average mesoscopic volume function eq . \n ( [ phi ] ) amenable to statistical calculations . \n next , we develop a statistical theory for the probability to find a voronoi volume in order to calculate the mesoscopic volume function by averaging the single grain function like in eq . \n ( [ phi ] ) . for a given grain , @xmath15 \n , the calculation reduces to finding the ball @xmath42 with @xmath61 where the minimization is over all grains ( see fig . \n [ volumec ] for notation ) . \n we consider @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and we set @xmath64 for simplicity . while the form eq . \n ( [ phi ] ) is valid for any dimension , the following statistical theory differs for each dimension . in what follows we work in 3d . \n results in 2d and large dimension will be presented in future papers . \n we consider the minimal particle contributing to the voronoi volume along the @xmath16 direction at @xmath65 ( see fig . \n [ volumec ] ) with    @xmath66    we call this particle , the voronoi particle . \n then the quantity to compute is the probability to find all the remaining particles in the packing at a distance larger than @xmath67 from particle @xmath15 along the @xmath16 direction . \n that is , we compute the inverse cumulative distribution function , denoted @xmath68 , to find all the grains @xmath42 with @xmath69 , and therefore not contributing to the voronoi volume .    in terms of fig . \n [ volumec]a , the minimal voronoi particle located at @xmath67 , determining the voronoi cell , defines an excluded volume , represented by the gray volume in the figure , where no other particle can be located ( otherwise they would contribute to the voronoi volume ) . \n we denote this excluded volume as @xmath70 . \n thus , @xmath68 represents the probability that the remaining particles in the packing have @xmath71 larger than @xmath67 and therefore are outside the gray volume @xmath70 in fig . \n [ volumec]a . \n if we know this inverse cumulative distribution , then the mesoscopic free volume function is obtained as the mean value of @xmath72 over the probability density @xmath73 : @xmath74 and @xmath75}{dc } dc = \\\\ - \\int_1^\\infty ( c^3 - 1 )    \\frac{dp_>(c)}{dc } dc = \\\\ \n -\\int_1 ^ 0 ( c^3 - 1 ) dp_>= \\int_0 ^ 1 ( c^3 - 1 ) dp_>. \\end{split } \\label{phi2}\\ ] ]    the integration in eq . \n ( [ phi2 ] ) ranges from @xmath76 to @xmath77 with respect to @xmath67 since the minimum distance for a ball is for @xmath78 and @xmath79 giving @xmath80 and the maximum at @xmath81 . \n when changing variables to @xmath82 , the limits of integration @xmath83 correspond to the inverse cumulative distribution function @xmath84 $ ] . \n next , we calculate the inverse cumulative distribution @xmath68 . considering the voronoi particle at distance @xmath67 , \n the remaining balls are in the bulk and in contact with the ball @xmath15 . \n a crucial step in the calculation is to separate the distribution into two contributions : a contact term , @xmath85 , and a bulk term , @xmath86 . \n this separation is important because it allows one to obtain the dependence of the average volume function on the coordination number . \n the contact term naturally depends on the number of contacting particles @xmath5 , while the bulk term depends on the average @xmath57 . since @xmath68 represents the probability that all the balls in the packing except the voronoi ball are outside the grey volume in fig . \n [ volumec]a , then the geometrical interpretation of the contact and bulk term is the following :    * @xmath87 represents the probability that the balls in the bulk are located outside the grey volume @xmath70 in fig . \n [ volumec]a . * \n @xmath85 represents the probability that the contact balls are located outside the boundary of the grey area marked in red in fig . \n [ volumec]b and denoted @xmath88 . \n an assumption of the theory is that both contributions are considered independent . \n therefore :    @xmath89    notice that the meaning of eq . \n ( [ indep ] ) is the following : we first assume that the voronoi particle is located at @xmath67 . \n then all remaining particles , including contact and bulk particles , are outside the grey excluded zone . \n this results in the multiplication of the probabilities as in eq . \n ( [ indep ] ) .      in order to calculate the distributions @xmath92 and @xmath93 we apply the following assumptions . \n we treat the general case of calculating the probability for @xmath1 particles in a system of volume @xmath94 to be outside a given volume @xmath95 when added at random . in 3d , this probability is nontrivial since the volume occupied by each ball in the packing should be greater than the size of the ball . \n however , this probability can be calculated exactly in the case of 1d in the large @xmath1 limit . in 1d \n , the distribution of possible arrangements of hard - rods corresponds to the distribution of ideal gas particles by removing the volume occupied by the size of the ball as we can see in fig . [ \n 1d_map ] . such \n a mapping is exact in 1d , implying an exponential distribution of the free volume .    the probability to locate one particle at random outside the volume @xmath95 in a system of volume @xmath94 is @xmath96 for @xmath1 independent particles , we obtain : @xmath97 we set @xmath98 and the particle density @xmath99 . \n then @xmath100 in the limit of a large number of particles , @xmath101 , we obtain a boltzmann - like exponential distribution for the probability of @xmath1 particles to be outside a volume @xmath95 : @xmath102    while the above derivation is exact in 1d , the extension to higher dimensions is an approximation , since there exist additional geometrical constraints . \n even if there is a void with enough volume to be occupied by a particle ( the volume of the void is larger or equal than the size of the particle ) , the constraint imposed by the geometrical shape of the particle ( which does not exist in 1d ) might prevent the void from being occupied . \n nevertheless , in what follows , we assume the exponential distribution of eq . \n ( [ expo ] ) to be valid in 3d as well . \n the background is assumed to be uniform with a mean free bulk particle density given by :    @xmath103    where we define the volume fraction @xmath104 . \n therefore , @xmath92 assumes a boltzmann - like distribution of the form analogous to eq . \n ( [ expo ] ) , @xmath105 where    @xmath106 \\end{split}\\ ] ]    is the volume of the grey area in fig . \n [ volumec]a . \n we obtain : @xmath107 therefore , @xmath108.\\ ] ]    the derivation of the surface term , @xmath85 , is analogous to that of the volume term . \n @xmath109 is assumed to have the same exponential form , analogous to the background form of @xmath110 , eq . ( [ expob ] ) , despite not having the large number approximation leading to eq . \n ( [ expo ] ) :    @xmath111    where @xmath112 is the excluded area marked in red in fig . \n [ volumec]b .    to define @xmath113 \n we first follow the analogy with the bulk density eq . \n ( [ rho ] ) , @xmath114 to obtain the mean free surface particle density on the sphere with @xmath5 contacting particles :    @xmath115    where @xmath116 is the surface occupied by a single contact ball , with @xmath117 a small value .    however , we notice that the analogy with eq . \n ( [ expo ] ) is more difficult to justify here since the large number limit is lacking for the surface term : the maximum number of contacting spheres , the so - called kissing number , is 12 and for disordered packings is 6 in average . \n thus , rather than considering eq . \n ( [ pc ] ) as the exact form of the surface term , we take the exponential form as a simple variational ansatz , where the surface density @xmath113 is the variational parameter which has to be corrected from eq . \n ( [ sf ] ) due to the small number of the balls on the surface .    a more physical definition of @xmath113 is a mean free density representing the inverse of the average of @xmath88 : @xmath118 . \n the meaning of @xmath119 for a given number of contacting particles is the following : add @xmath5 contact particles at random around a central sphere . \n the average of the solid angles of the gaps left between nearest neighbor contacting spheres is @xmath120 ( see fig . \n [ volumed ] ) . \n indeed we obtain : @xmath121}{dc}dc \\\\ & =   \\int_1^\\infty s^*(c)\\rho_s\\exp(-\\rho_s s^*(c))\\frac{ds^*}{dc}dc \\\\ & =   \\rho_s\\int_0^{2\\pi } s^*\\exp(-\\rho_s s^*)ds^ * \\\\ & \\approx   \\rho_s\\int_0^{\\infty } s^*\\exp(-\\rho_s s^*)ds^ * \\\\ & = 1/\\rho_s \\end{split}\\ ] ] then , the surface density is replaced by the following definition : @xmath122    under these considerations , in order to estimate the value of @xmath113 we first consider a single particle approximation . \n we calculate the mean of @xmath123 for a single particle @xmath124 , which gives @xmath125 , since @xmath123 ranges uniformly from @xmath126 to @xmath127 . \n we note that the value is different from the prediction of eq . \n ( [ sf ] ) in the large number limit . \n since we expect @xmath113 to be proportional to @xmath5 , under a single particle approximation we find : @xmath128    simulations considering many @xmath5 contacting particles suggest that corrections from the single particle approximation are important for larger @xmath5 . indeed \n , a more precise value is obtained from simulations :    @xmath129    deviating from the single particle approximation of eq . \n ( [ single ] ) . \n this numerical calculation consists of adding @xmath5 random , non - overlapping , equal - size spheres at the surface of a ball . for every fix @xmath5 , the sphere closest to the direction \n @xmath16 defines the free angle @xmath130 and the surface @xmath131 ( see fig . \n [ volumed ] ) . \n thus , the idea is to measure the mean gap , @xmath132 , left by @xmath5 contacting particles along the @xmath16 direction . as seen in fig . \n [ sqrt ] , simulations show that the more precise value , eq . \n ( [ many ] ) is valid rather than the single particle approximation , eq . \n ( [ single ] ) . \n this many - particle result can be explained by adding a small correction term from the area occupied by one particle into eq . \n ( [ single ] ) . in the case of many contact particles , @xmath133 , \n many body constraints imply that the surface , @xmath132 , should be corrected by the solid angle extended by a single ball , and at the same time reduced by the increasing number of contacting particles . \n thus , up to first order approximation , @xmath134 this analysis provides a correction to the surface term which can be approximated as @xmath135 it is clear that the above derivation is by no means exact . \n it merely interprets the origin of the correction from the single particle approximation in order to obtain a proper estimation of the surface density . \n the obtained value agrees very well with the computer simulations results of fig . \n [ sqrt ] and eq . \n ( [ many ] ) , and therefore we use it to define @xmath85 . in comparison with numerical simulations , \n the derived form of @xmath136 compares well as we will show in fig . \n furthermore , the predicted average volume fraction compares well with experiments on random close packings .    from eqs . \n ( [ pc ] ) , ( [ sc ] ) and ( [ sqrt3 ] ) , we obtain the surface term : @xmath137,\\ ] ] and the inverse cumulative distribution of volumes takes the form : @xmath138 . \\label{pc1}\\ ] ] \n substituting eq . \n ( [ pc1 ] ) into eq . \n ( [ phi2 ] ) , we obtain a self - consistent equation to calculate the average free volume , @xmath57 :    @xmath139 . \\end{split } \\label{w1}\\ ] ]    since    @xmath140,\\ ] ]    then eq . ( [ w1 ] ) can be solved exactly , leading to an analytical form of the free average volume function , under the approximations of the theory . \n the fact that we can solve this equation exactly is a fortuitous event . \n it is worth mentioning that an analogous analysis performed in 2d as well as in infinite dimensions does not lead to an analytical solution of the self - consistent equation ( [ w1 ] ) and therefore only numerical solutions are possible for the average volume function in those dimensions under similar assumptions as used in 3d .    to solve eq . \n ( [ w1 ] ) we start from the identity : @xmath141 then we find : @xmath142 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath143 . or @xmath144 - 1 \\\\    & = \\alpha \\int_{0}^{1 } \\frac{1}{w } \\left(1-\\frac{1}{c}\\right ) d    \\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{w}\\left((c^3 - 1)- \\alpha        ( 1-\\frac{1}{c})\\right)\\right ] . \n \\end{split } \\label{w2}\\ ] ]    the second integration in the right hand side is equal to zero only at @xmath145 or @xmath146 , corresponding to two trivial solutions at @xmath147 and @xmath148 , respectively . \n the only non - trivial solution happens at @xmath149 , and therefore we find @xmath150    we arrive at a mesoscopic volume function ( plotted in fig . \n [ state]a ) which is more amenable to a statistical mechanics approach for jammed matter . \n equation ( [ phi3 ] ) is a coarse - grained `` hamiltonian '' or volume function that replaces the microscopic eq . \n ( [ vor1 ] ) to describe the mesoscopic states of jammed matter . \n ( [ vor1 ] ) is difficult to treat analytically in statistical mechanics , the advantage of the mesoscopic eq . \n ( [ phi3 ] ) is that it can easily be incorporated into a partition function since it depends only on @xmath5 instead of all degrees of freedom @xmath151 . \n if the system is fully random , so that we can extend the assumption of uniformity from the mesoscopic scales to the macroscopic scales , we arrive to an equation of state relating @xmath152 with @xmath5 as : @xmath153 thus , eq . ( [ phi4 ] ) , plotted in fig . \n [ state]b , can be interpreted as a equation of state for fully random jammed matter . \n we recall that it has been obtained under the approximation of a packing achieving a completely random state ; the proper test of such an equation would be to add spheres at random and observe their distribution and average values . in a second paper of this series @xcite we will show that it corresponds to the equation of state in the limit of infinite compactivity when the system is fully randomized . \n indeed , eq . ( [ phi4 ] ) already provides the density of random loose packings and random close packings when the coordination number is replaced by the isostatic limits of 4 and 6 , for infinitely rough and frictionless particles , respectively . \n so far , our analysis only includes geometrical constraints , but has not made use of the mechanical constraint of jamming . \n the jamming condition can be introduced through the condition of isostaticity which applies to the mechanical coordination number , @xmath154 , for rigid spherical grains @xcite . for isostatic packings the mechanical coordination number \n is bounded by @xmath155 and @xmath156 and we obtain the minimum and maximum volume fraction from eq . \n ( [ phi4 ] ) as @xmath157 and @xmath158 as shown in fig . \n [ state]b . \n we identify these limits as the random close packing ( rcp ) and random loose packing ( rlp ) fractions ( the maximum and minimum possible volumes of random packings of spherical particles ) . \n this result is fully explored in jamming ii @xcite where the phase space of jammed configurations is obtained using edwards statistical mechanics of jammed matter based on eq . \n ( [ phi3 ] ) . \n we note that the mechanical coordination , @xmath154 , is not the same as the geometrical one , @xmath5 ( see @xcite for details ) , and an equation of state of jammed matter should be a relation between state variables , such as average global volume fraction @xmath159 and mechanical coordination number @xmath154 . \n however , it can be shown that in the limit of infinite compactivity , the mechanical coordination number @xmath154 is identical to the geometrical coordination number @xmath5 , and the equation of state in this case has the same form of eq . \n ( [ phi4 ] ) . \n thus for now , it suffices to say that we can obtain the two packing limits from eq . \n ( [ phi4 ] ) in the case of fully random systems of infinite compactivity . \n the experimental studies of @xcite on the free volume versus coordination number of grains in tomography studies of random packings of spheres support eq . \n ( [ phi4 ] ) ( see fig . 6 in @xcite ) .      equation ( [ phi3 ] ) should be interpreted as representing quasiparticles with free volume @xmath57 and coordination number @xmath5 . when a grain jams in a packing , it interacts with other grains . \n the role of this interaction is assumed in the calculation of the volume function ( [ phi3 ] ) and is implicit in the coarse - graining procedure explained above . \n thus , the quasiparticles can be considered as particles in a self - consistent field of surrounding jammed matter . in the presence of this field , \n the volume of the quasiparticles depends on the surrounding particles , as expressed in eq . \n ( [ phi3 ] ) . \n the assembly of quasiparticles can be regarded as a set of non - interacting particles ( when the number of elementary excitations is sufficiently low ) . \n the jammed system can be considered as an ideal gas of quasiparticles and a single particle partition function can be used to evaluate the ensemble . \n these ideas are exploited in the definition of the partition function leading to the solution of the phase diagram discussed in jamming ii @xcite . \n in this section , we wish to test some predictions and approximations of the theory and propose the necessary improvements where needed . \n the purpose of this calculation is , first , to evaluate the predictions of the theory regarding the inverse cumulative volume distributions , and , second , to test whether the background distribution is independent of the contact distribution by comparing @xmath160 with @xmath161 . \n it is important to note that the predictions of the mesoscopic theory refer to quasiparticles as discussed above . \n the quasiparticles of free volume eq . \n ( [ phi3 ] ) of fix coordination number can be considered as the building blocks or elementary units of jammed matter . to properly study their properties and test the predictions and approximations of the present theory one should in principle isolate the behavior of the quasiparticles and study their statistical properties such as the distribution of volumes and their mean value as a function of coordination number . \n such a study is being carried out and may lead to a more precise solutions than the one presented in the present paper . \n nevertheless , in what follows we take an approximate numerical route and study the behavior of quasiparticles directly from computer generated packings with molecular dynamics . while such packings already contain the ensemble average of the quasiparticle \n , we argue that in some limits they could provide statistics for isolated quasiparticles , at least approximately . \n this is due to a result that needs to wait until jamming ii @xcite , where we find that for a system of frictionless packings there is a unique state of jamming at the mesoscopic level and therefore the compactivity and the ensemble average does not play a role , at least under the mesoscopic approximation developed here . \n therefore , below , we use frictionless packings in order to test the theory . \n we note , though , that the conclusions of this section remain approximative , waiting for a more precise study of the packings of fixed coordination number . \n we prepare a frictionless packing at the jamming transition with methods explained in jamming ii . \n the packing consists of 10,000 spherical particles interacting with hertz forces . in the simulation \n , we pick up a direction @xmath13 randomly , and collect @xmath162 and @xmath163 from the balls , as follows :    @xmath164    thus , for a given direction , we find two minimum values of @xmath67 independently as @xmath162 and @xmath163 over all particles in the packing . \n we then collect data for 400 different directions . \n the @xmath162 is only provided by the balls in the background , and @xmath163 is only provided by the balls in contact . from the probability density , we then calculate the cumulative probability to find a ball at position @xmath165 and @xmath166 such that @xmath167 . \n that is , we calculate the cumulative distribution of @xmath162 and @xmath163 individually , i.e. , @xmath168 and @xmath169 . \n the inverse cumulative distributions are plotted fig . \n [ pbpc ] showing that the theory approximately captures the trend of these functions but deviations exist as well , especially for @xmath67 values larger than its average . \n the contact term @xmath85 is well approximated by the theory supporting the approximations involved in the calculation of the surface density term , eq . \n ( [ sqrt3 ] ) . \n the background term shows deviations for larger @xmath67 ; for smaller @xmath67 the theory is not too far from simulations . from fig . \n [ pbpc ] we notice that @xmath161 is well reproduced by the theory up to a value of 10% of its peak value . \n it is important to note that the mesoscopic volume function , @xmath57 , is extracted from the mean value of @xmath170 as @xmath171 . \n while some deviations are found in the inverse cumulative distribution , we find that the average value of the volumes are well approximated by the theory . indeed , we find that the deviations from the theoretical probabilities for @xmath172 appear not to contribute significantly towards the average volume function . \n for instance , the packing in fig . \n [ pbpc ] has a volume fraction @xmath173 as measured from the particle positions . \n this value agrees with the average @xmath170 obtained from the prediction of the probability distribution @xmath68 . \n we find @xmath174 = 1.561 , then @xmath170 = @xmath175 and @xmath176 in agreement with the volume fraction of the entire packing obtained from the position of all the balls , @xmath177 . \n thus , the present theory gives a good approximation to the average voronoi volume needed for the mesoscopic volume function , even though the full distribution presents deviations from the theory . in order to capture all the moments of the distribution \n a more refined theory is needed . \n such a theory will include the corrections to the exponential forms of @xmath87 and @xmath85 and their correlations . \n the main result of the mesoscopic theory , being the average voronoi volume decreasing with the number of contacts , is not affected by the assumptions of the theory for the full probability distribution . \n the correlations between the contact and bulk term are quantified by comparing @xmath178 with @xmath161 in fig . \n [ pbpc ] . from the figure \n we see that below and around the mean @xmath179 , the full distribution is close to the theoretical result while deviations appear for larger @xmath67 . \n further testing of the existence of correlations between @xmath87 and @xmath85 is obtained by calculating the product - moment coefficient of pearson s correlation as follows . \n the pearson s coefficient is :    @xmath180    where @xmath181 , @xmath182 , and @xmath183 . \n we find that the pearson coefficient @xmath184 is close to zero , meaning that the correlations between @xmath110 and @xmath109 are weak . \n the present numerical results imply that the current assumptions of the theory are reasonable . \n the conclusions are that while the cumulative distributions present deviations from the theory in their tails , the average value of the voronoi volumes are well captured by the approximations of the theory , therefore providing an accurate value for the volume function . \n more importantly , the present approach indicates a way to improve the theory to provide more accurate results . \n our current studies indicate that an exact solution of the distribution , @xmath68 , may be possible up to the second coordination shell of particles , for a fixed z - ensemble . due to the fact that the range of voronoi cell is finite , it is possible to work out a description for the finite , but large , number of degrees of freedom for both disordered and ordered packings through computational linear programming , in principle . \n this approach is related to the hales proof of the kepler conjecture @xcite . \n the present theory is a mean - field version in terms of the restricted description of the disordered packings , which allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the original problem in order to write down the analytic form of the volume function in reasonable agreement with known values of rcp and rlp . \n the present approximations of the theory are further supported by agreement between the obtained form of the volume function and the empirical findings of the experiments of @xcite . in a future paper \n we will present a more exact theory of the volume fluctuations capturing not only the mean value but also higher moments . \n it is of interest to test the formula eq . \n ( [ phi3 ] ) with the well - known example of the fcc lattice at @xmath185 to assess the approximations of the theory . at this limiting number of neighbors the entire class of attainable orientational voronoi cells \n have volumes in a very narrow range around @xmath186 which is larger than the prediction from eq . \n ( [ phi3 ] ) . \n the free volume of the fcc voronoi cell is @xmath187 while the mesoscopic volume function for @xmath185 gives @xmath188 , below the real value . \n we explain this discrepancy since the current theory is developed under the assumption of isotropic packings . \n isotropic packings are explicitly taken into account in the theory considering the orientational voronoi volume @xmath53 ( along a direction @xmath189 ) as a simplification of the full voronoi volume , @xmath190 . \n such a simplification is meaningful for isotropic packings but fails for anisotropic or ordered packings . indeed , \n in the case of packings with strong angular correlations , the `` weak - coupling '' hypothesis employed here does not work well . \n the extension of the current theory to anisotropic packings , such as the fcc lattice at @xmath185 , can be carried out , but remains outside of the scope of the present work . in this case , the full voronoi volume of eq . \n ( [ vor1 ] ) must be used . \n eventually a volume function that accounts for disordered and ordered packings is very important . \n this volume function could test the existence of phase transition between the ordered and disordered phases . \n the theory we propose here is a quasiparticle version in terms of the restricted description of the disordered packings , which allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the original problem in order to write down the analytic form of the volume function . \n the fact that eq . ( [ phi3 ] ) \n does not predict correctly the volume of fcc but does predict correctly the volume of rcp raises the interesting possibility that there could be a phase transition at rcp , an intriguing possibility which is being explored at the moment . \n in summary , we present a plausible volume function describing the states of jammed matter . the definition of @xmath2 is purely geometrical and , therefore , can be extended to unjammed systems such as colloids at lower concentrations . in its microscopic definition , \n the volume function is shown to be the voronoi volume per particle , and an analytical formula is derived for it . \n however this form is still intractable in a statistical mechanics analysis . \n we then develop a mesoscopic version of @xmath2 involving coarse graining over a few particles that reduces the degrees of freedom to a single variable , @xmath5 . \n this renders the problem within the reach of analytical calculations . \n the significance of our results is that they allow the development of a statistical mechanics to predict the observables by using the volume function in a boltzmann - like probability distribution of states @xcite when the analysis is supplemented by the jamming condition a la alexander @xcite ; which we propose in @xcite to be the isostatic condition for rigid particles .", "human_aspect": "{\n  \"background\": \"we introduce a `` hamiltonian''-like function , called the volume function , indispensable to describe the ensemble of jammed matter such as granular materials and emulsions from a geometrical point of view.\",\n  \"method\": \"at the microscopic level , we show that the volume function is the voronoi volume associated to each particle and in turn we provide an analytical formula for the voronoi volume in terms of the contact network , valid for any dimension. we then develop a statistical theory for the probability distribution of the volumes in 3d to calculate an average volume function coarse - grained at a mesoscopic level.\",\n  \"result\": \"the salient result is the discovery of a mesoscopic volume function inversely proportional to the coordination number.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"our analysis is the first step toward the calculation of macroscopic observables and equations of state using the statistical mechanics of jammed matter , when supplemented by the condition of mechanical equilibrium of jamming that properly defines jammed matter at the ensemble level.\"\n}", "gpt35_aspect": "{\n  \"background\": \"The article discusses the challenges in developing a statistical mechanics approach for granular matter and other jammed materials.

We investigate this model using the dynamical triangulation approach and perform Monte Carlo simulations of surfaces embedded in a 4-dimensional target space. Our results provide insight into the typical geometrical features of surfaces that play an important role in the ensemble generated by the IKKT matrix model. We find that the singularities of the purely bosonic model are removed by adding fermions, and the large distance behavior of the partition function is dominated by tube-like configurations. Our simulations show that tubes indeed dominate in the ensemble, and we discuss the relation of our results to the matrix model. The action for IIB strings can be cast into a form that includes bosonic coordinates, fermionic coordinates, and a metric tensor. For critical dimensions, the dimensionality of the spinor representation is 16, and for non-critical strings, we have 10-dimensional spinors.

negative function of bosonic coordinates @xmath96 , a feature that is essential for the mc simulations . \n it follows from the structure of the matrix @xmath92 , which has pairs of complex conjugated eigenvalues @xmath97 . \n ( more specifically , if @xmath98 is an eigenvector to the eigenvalue @xmath50 , then @xmath99 is an eigenvector to the eigenvalue @xmath100 . ) \n the final form of the partition function is now @xmath101 where for convenience we introduced an additional parameter @xmath102 . \n for @xmath103 we have the purely bosonic model ; @xmath104 is the case considered in @xcite ; and @xmath105 corresponds to our partition function . \n as we will see , the model with @xmath105 , for which the number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom is susy  balanced , is the only interesting one , because only in this case is the partition function well - defined . \n the behaviour of the partition function for the purely bosonic model @xmath106 has already been discussed in the context of the quantization of the nambu - goto string @xcite , where it was shown that this partition function is in general not integrable . \n namely , one can explicitly construct triangulations for which the integral over bosonic fields is divergent . \n the source of this divergence can be intuitively explained as follows . \n the bosonic part of the action is the sum of all triangle areas squared , with the areas measured in the target space . \n thus , as long as the areas of all triangles stay constant , we can change their shape without changing the action . as an example , let us pick an arbitrary vertex @xmath107 on the triangulation . \n it has @xmath108 neighbouring vertices that are linked to each other , forming a loop around @xmath107 ( see figure [ spikes ] ( left ) ) . \n origin of spikes  : ( left ) when the white points approach each other to a distance @xmath109 , then the black point can freely move in the embedding space inside a sphere of radius @xmath110 . \n ( right ) example of the non  integrable configuration : the entropy factor from four spikes ( black points ) overcomes the damping effect of the entropy that comes from the white points which are forced to move close to each other.,title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]   origin of spikes  : ( left ) when the white points approach each other to a distance @xmath109 , then the black point can freely move in the embedding space inside a sphere of radius @xmath110 . \n ( right ) example of the non  integrable configuration : the entropy factor from four spikes ( black points ) overcomes the damping effect of the entropy that comes from the white points which are forced to move close to each other.,title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]    each link in this loop is the base of one of @xmath107 s neighbouring triangles . now let us shrink these bases to a small length @xmath111 . \n ( obviously , this step _ will _ change the action , but this is a _ \n finite _ and _ local _ change that is bounded independently of @xmath111 . ) \n next , we can move @xmath107 outward to a distance of about @xmath112 , thus creating a long ` spike ' . in this way \n , we can have an arbitrarily long spike that does not visibly affect the action if we just simultaneously make the bases small enough . \n the phase space volume for such a configuration is a factor @xmath113 coming from the point @xmath107 times a factor @xmath114 coming from constraining the @xmath108 neighbours of @xmath107 to a sphere of radius @xmath111 around one of them . \n thus , a spike of length @xmath17 is suppressed , but only _ power  like _ , _ i.e. _ the spikes are not cut off at any particular scale and arbitrarily long fluctuations can occur . when instead of a single  vertex spike one considers configurations with multiple spikes , such as the one in figure [ spikes ] ( right ) , one can check that the spike length distribution may have a logarithmic or stronger divergence . \n the question that now arises is , what can be expected to change in this picture if we add the fermionic part to the action and consider the complete partition function @xmath115 ? intuitively , it seems that fermions should introduce a repulsive core to the effective potential between neighbouring vertices on the triangulation , and that this repulsion should prevent vertices from occupying the same position in the target space , which in turn should keep the loop around each vertex from shrinking beyond a certain minimal length . in this case , to create a spike would cost energy , because now the area of a triangle would have to grow to allow it to become elongated . \n therefore , one can hope that the introduction of fermions might suppress spikes , along with the divergences they cause .    introducing the fermions \n is equivalent to replacing the bosonic action @xmath55 with an effective action @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the determinant of the matrix defined in . @xmath118 \n vanishes if for any vertex all its neighbouring vertices meet in a single point , because then the two rows of the matrix that correspond to this vertex become zero . similarly , \n if all neighbouring vertices do not exactly meet in one point but move very close to each other , then all entries in these two rows become very small , and the determinant as a whole should likewise become small . in other words , we expect the determinant to discourage small loops and hence also spikes . \n it is natural to expect that short loop lengths will be suppressed by a power - like fall - off .    to test this , we used standard monte carlo methods to simulate the model with fermions . \n the triangulations , weighted by the effective action , were produced by a metropolis algorithm for geometrical flips and updates of the fields @xmath21 . in four dimensions \n the effective action is well - defined since the determinant is positive definite as discussed before . \n the bulk of the computer time is spent on calculating the determinant @xmath95 . \n this allowed us to produce reasonably large statistics only for fairly small systems ( up to 16 vertices ) .     the gyration radius versus the shortest loop around a vertex on the triangulation , for the model without fermions ( left ) and with fermions ( right ) . \n the number of vertices is @xmath119.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ] the gyration radius versus the shortest loop around a vertex on the triangulation , for the model without fermions ( left ) and with fermions ( right ) . \n the number of vertices is @xmath119.,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]    the simplest quantity to measure is the average action . using the fact that the bosonic action and the fermionic determinant are uniform polynomials of the bosonic co - ordinates , one can show by a simple scaling argument that the average bosonic action for @xmath30 is @xmath120 . \n we used this formula as a rough test of the program . \n we also measured the gyration radius @xmath121 and the length of the smallest loop around a vertex that appears on each configuration . \n ( ` length ' , here , means the sum of the squared lengths of all links in the loop . ) \n figure [ loop_spikes ] ( left ) shows that in the purely bosonic model there is a strong correlation between the appearance of short loops on the triangulation and a large gyration radius , which supports the picture discussed in the previous section . \n note that all results for the bosonic model should be taken with a generous helping of salt , since as noted above the partition function is actually not defined . \n these results are presented here merely to illustrate the fact that the source of the singularities can really be found in the appearance of local spikes ( see figure [ needle ] ( left ) ) . for the fermionic case , \n small loops are clearly suppressed , and the only correlation between loop lengths and gyration radius is a trivial one , namely that if the shortest link on a triangulation has a length @xmath111 , the gyration radius itself can not be smaller than @xmath111 , either . \n we conclude that fermions do in fact suppress spikes . for the smallest possible spherical triangulation , the tetrahedron \n , one can actually show analytically that the partition function for the fermionic model exists in four dimensions , whereas for the bosonic model it does not @xcite . \n however , both the analytical calculations for the tetrahedron and numerical simulations of larger surfaces indicate that even in the fermionic case the gyration radius distribution has a power  like tail ( see the appendix and figure  [ fig : hist ] ( left ) ) . what is the source of the singular behaviour in this case , when we know that we do not have local spikes ? \n it turns out that there is another type of configuration that can contribute to the tail of the probability distribution @xmath2 for large @xmath3 . \n these things look like _ needles _ ; the four - dimensional degrees of freedom of the co - ordinates in the target space collapse to a one - dimensional , elongated narrow tube .     snapshots of a susy triangulation from the tail of the gyration radius distribution ( right ) , and a bosonic configuration of comparable size ( left ) . \n the @xmath122-component in the plot corresponds to the projection of the vertex position onto the longest principal axis in the system , while the @xmath123-component describes the distance from the axis . \n @xmath17 denotes the length of the tube , @xmath111 its radius and @xmath3 the gyration radius , title=\"fig:\",width=245 ] snapshots of a susy triangulation from the tail of the gyration radius distribution ( right ) , and a bosonic configuration of comparable size ( left ) . \n the @xmath122-component in the plot corresponds to the projection of the vertex position onto the longest principal axis in the system , while the @xmath123-component describes the distance from the axis . \n @xmath17 denotes the length of the tube , @xmath111 its radius and @xmath3 the gyration radius , title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]    to indentify these configurations we used the principal component analysis ( pca ) . for each analysed configuration we calculated the correlation matrix @xmath124 and its eigenvalues \n the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue defined the principial axis . \n for each point on the configuration @xmath48 we then calculated its projection on the pricipial axis , @xmath125 , and its distance from it , @xmath126 . \n we defined the length @xmath17 and radius @xmath111 of the tube by @xmath127 the ratio of length to width can serve as an estimator of the type of the configuration . \n for the bosonic string , this ratio was @xmath128 , and for the fermionic one , @xmath129 . \n two typical results of this analysis are depicted in figure [ needle ] where we show , for comparison , snapshots of triangulations for the bosonic ( left ) and susy ( right ) models for @xmath130 , projected onto the principal axis . \n how can the appearance of needles be explained ? \n the bosonic part of the action is a sum of contributions from separate triangles . \n the contribution from a single triangle is minimal when its three vertices lie on a line , in which case the square of the triangle area is zero . \n one type of zero - action triangles are the spikes that were discussed in the previous section . on a spike \n , two vertices of the triangle lie very close to  or , in the limiting case , on top of  each other , so that together with the third vertex they will automatically form a line . \n another possible type of zero - action triangles are those that have three distinct ( and distant ) points that lie on , or close to , a single line . from the point of view of just one triangle , this type of zero - action configuration is more likely to occur than a spiky one , for which one has to move two vertices into exactly the same point ; but when one looks at the triangulation as a whole , one sees that the probability for this to happen is actually much smaller , because having three long links means that either there will be three neighbouring triangles with large areas ( which is suppressed by the action ) , or there will be three more triangles lying on exactly the same line . \n the same argument can then be applied to the neighbours of _ these _ triangles as well , and on and on until one arrives at a configuration where all triangles lie on a single line , _ i.e. _ a configuration that is just one - dimensional \n . contrary to spikes , which are defects that involve only a few triangles and that are basically independent of the rest of the triangulation , a needle requires a global arrangement of vertices that minimizes the action . \n such a global arrangement is entropically disfavoured and therefore does not occur in the bosonic model . here \n , however , the fermionic determinant provides an additional factor that favours configurations with vertices far removed from each other . \n as it turns out , this term is sufficient to exceed the damping effect coming from the entropy .    to see this \n , we will try to estimate the contribution of the needle  like configurations to the partition function . \n let us assume that we fix one point on the surface ( thus getting rid of the zero mode ) , and also set the length of one link emerging from this point to @xmath17 . in the following , we will refer to the direction along this link as _ long _ and to the transverse directions as _ short_. consider now a tube of radius @xmath131 around the long direction . \n clearly , if we constrain all the points to lie inside the tube , the area of each triangle will not exceed @xmath132 . \n as the action is the sum of the areas squared of the individual triangles , it will be bounded from above by @xmath133 _ independently _ of @xmath17 . \n assuming that all the vertices are free to move independently inside the tube , we can estimate the contribution to the partition function coming from this configuration as  : @xmath134 here , @xmath135 is the fermionic determinant for the tube  like configuration . \n we have to integrate over only @xmath136 vertex positions because we already fixed one of them . by choosing a convenient co - ordinate system \n , we can set this fixed vertex to the origin , and the vertex at the other end of the link to @xmath137 . \n this naturally defines the direction of the needle . \n since the needle may point in any direction in four - dimensional space , integration over the position of this point contributes a factor @xmath138 to the integral . \n each of the @xmath139 remaining vertices then contributes one integration over @xmath17 and three integrations over short components , resulting finally in . \n the determinant @xmath135 is a uniform polynomial of degree @xmath140 , so one would expect at first glance that in the large @xmath17 limit the leading contribution should be @xmath141 . \n however , as we will show in the appendix , because of additional symmetries of the matrix all terms containing only long directions cancel , and we get @xmath142 for even @xmath68 and @xmath143 for odd @xmath68 . inserting this into and integrating over all but one long component  which corresponds to substituting @xmath144 and @xmath145 \n we eventually obtain  : @xmath146 because the configuration is essentially one  dimensional and the length of the tube is given by @xmath17 , we expect the gyration radius to be proportional to this , @xmath147 . \n thus , for large @xmath3 , we expect a similarly power  like tail in the gyration radius distribution , @xmath148 _ if _ the needle  like configurations dominate in the partition function .    for the purely bosonic case @xmath103 , @xmath149 grows with the size of the system and the tail becomes less singular . \n this suppresses needles . \n in fact , as we already discussed , in this case the spiky configurations win entropically over the needles , and it is they who are responsible for the singularities of the partition function for bosonic surfaces .    for @xmath105 , the formula gives @xmath150 for configurations with an even number of vertices and @xmath151 for those with an odd number . \n these exponents do not grow with @xmath68 . \n for @xmath152 , the exponent @xmath153 decreases with @xmath68 and very quickly becomes smaller than one . \n the tail @xmath154 of @xmath2 becomes non - integrable , signalling that the partition does not exist in this case except for a very few small systems that have @xmath153 larger than one , such as the tetrahedron , for which the formula predicts @xmath155 . \n ( this result for the tetrahedron can actually be derived in a straightforward analytic calculation , as shown in the appendix . )    to test these predictions , we measured the exponent @xmath153 numerically for different values of @xmath68 and @xmath102 . \n numerical simulations for problems with a power  like distribution are difficult because in this case one has rare but important events . in our case \n , the distribution @xmath156 means that we expect rare , long excursions in the configuration space which produce large @xmath3 s . technically , it is difficult to explore this part of the phase space , because the bulk of the probability distribution is concentrated around small @xmath3 where the program spends almost the whole time . \n to prevent this , we introduced a lower limit @xmath157 on @xmath3 , as well as an upper limit @xmath158 to prevent the program from doing too long excursions to large values of @xmath3 . \n otherwise , the program would not have a well defined autocorrelation time . \n experimentally we found it convenient to set the limits @xmath159 and @xmath160 when we expected a negative @xmath153 , and only an upper limit @xmath161 when we expected the distribution @xmath2 to grow with @xmath3 . in figure \n [ fig : hist ] , we show two examples of the numerically obtained distribution @xmath2  : for @xmath130 and @xmath162 , where according to the formula ( [ pl ] ) we expect @xmath163 , and for @xmath164 and @xmath165 , where we expect @xmath166 . \n ( note that in the latter case , the partition function would be ill - defined without the upper limit imposed on @xmath3 . \n we consider it here only for the purpose of testing our formula . ) \n the distribution @xmath2 for @xmath130 and @xmath162 ( left ) and @xmath164 and @xmath165 ( right).,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ] the distribution @xmath2 for @xmath130 and @xmath162 ( left ) and @xmath164 and @xmath165 ( right).,title=\"fig:\",width=245 ]    the numerical results for @xmath153 are summarized in table  [ tab : alpha ] . \n .[tab : alpha]values of the exponent @xmath153 for various combinations of @xmath68 and @xmath102 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can divide these results into three different cases . for @xmath104 , where needles are expected to not just create a tail in the distribution but instead dominate it entirely , the agreement is wonderful , and there is no question that our formula is correct . for @xmath105 and configurations with an even number of vertices , the results are somewhat off , but still in the ballpark of what we expect . \n one possibility is that this discrepancy is due to finite size effects , and would diminish if we were to go to larger systems ; another is that our theoretical argument is simply too rough and works only as a first approximation . in any case , we know from the analysis of sample configurations , as presented in figure [ needle ] , that we do have needles in this case . for @xmath105 and an odd number of vertices , the difference is huge but not surprising , since the analysis shows that these configurations are not needles , but look rather like small clumps with a single long spike growing out of them . \n it would seem that these things are suppressed by a power that is smaller than @xmath167 but still larger than @xmath168 , so that they can dominate over needles in odd-@xmath68 cases but not in even-@xmath68 ones . \n the estimate of the large @xmath3 behaviour of the gyration radius distribution for needle - like configurations can easily be extended to the @xmath169 and @xmath13 cases . \n since we saw in the four  dimensional case that needles are dominant only for even @xmath68 , we restrict ourselves to these systems . if we repeat the counting of long and short degrees of freedom as in , we get with @xmath170  : @xmath171 where @xmath135 is now the determinant or the pfaffian of the weyl fermion matrix in @xmath172 and @xmath13 , respectively . \n the function @xmath135 is a uniform polynomial of the bosonic components of order for @xmath173 . because of zero modes occurring in the minimal blocks of the fermionic matrix ( as discussed in detail for @xmath30 in the appendix ) , the terms with maximal power of @xmath17 cancel and the leading terms for large @xmath17 are @xmath174 \n thus , for the tube we get @xmath175 . \n inserting this into leaves us with @xmath176 in the susy case , _ \n i. e. _ @xmath105 , the tail of the probability distribution @xmath177 is independent of @xmath68 . \n it is the same behaviour as the one obtained in the matrix model from the analysis of the spectrum of large eigenvalues @xcite .    for @xmath152 , \n the needle - like configurations lead to a non \n integrable singularity and the partition function is divergent in this case . for @xmath103 , \n the singularity becomes softer when @xmath68 goes to infinity . \n we know , however , that in this case needles do not play any important role in the picture .    to summarize , the discussion presented above allows predictions for the singular behaviour of the partition function in those cases when needle  like configurations dominate in the ensemble . \n we have investigated geometrical properties of the large @xmath0 limit of the ikkt matrix model , which corresponds also to the reduced supersymmetric yang - mills theory @xcite . \n we showed that the originally four - dimensional theory reduces to a one - dimensional one and is dominated by elongated tube - like configurations . \n the gyration radius distribution has a power  like tail @xmath156 , where @xmath153 is roughly consistent with the value of @xmath178 obtained from the theoretical power  counting for needle - like configurations . \n repeated in @xmath179 the power  counting for such one  dimensional configurations gives distributions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . \n strikingly , the same behaviour is expected from the analysis of the large @xmath3 singularities of the matrix model yang - mills integrals @xcite . \n this result has never been proven for the matrix model ( except for @xmath180 ) , but if it holds , in view of our geometrical picture it would mean that the yang  mills integrals are also dominated by one  dimensional structures for large @xmath3 .    it is clear from our considerations that if too many fermionic degrees of freedom were added to the model ( @xmath181 ) , the power @xmath153 would decrease with @xmath68 and the partition function would soon become divergent . on the other hand , \n if there were too few degrees of freedom , as in the purely bosonic case , the singularity of the needle  like configurations would become softer for larger @xmath68 similarly as in the purely bosonic matrix model @xcite . \n we know , however , that in this case the surface model has a different type of singularity , corresponding to the local creation of spikes , caused by a sort of local flat direction in the action . \n the effect introduces a stronger singularity that , again , makes the partition function ill - defined . in summary , only the proper susy balance between fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom guarantees the existence of the surface theory . \n the results presented in this work are based on numerical simulations of rather small systems . \n it would be very interesting to perform a systematic analysis of the finite size effects . \n this would , however , require a considerable effort to improve the fermionic algorithm . \n the work was partially supported by the dfg pe 340/9 - 1 grant , the ec ihp network _ \n hprn - ct-1999 - 000161 _ and the kbn grants 2p03b00814 and 2p03b14917 . \n p.b . acknowledges financial support from the alexander von humboldt foundation during the first stage of this work . \n in the first part of the appendix , we will shortly repeat calculations of the partition function @xmath182 for the tetrahedron @xcite , and extend them to calculate the probability distribution of the link length .    introduce a co - ordinate system in the target space such that the origin coincides with one of these vertices , setting \n _ e. g. _ @xmath183 . \n next , choose the four axes  called here @xmath184 and @xmath185  such that one other vertex lies on the @xmath17 axis , one lies in the @xmath186 plane , and one in the @xmath187 hyperplane . \n thus , we have @xmath188 , @xmath189 , and @xmath190 . \n the determinant @xmath95 in this co - ordinate system becomes @xcite @xmath191 inserting this into and integrating out all co - ordinates except @xmath192 and @xmath193 leads to @xmath194 for large @xmath192 , @xmath193 is of order @xmath195 , fixed by the combination @xmath196 in the exponent . \n the integration over @xmath193 therefore effectively corresponds to setting @xmath197 ( including in the measure @xmath198 ) . \n thus , for large @xmath192 , the resulting integral is dominated by the contribution @xmath199 the component @xmath192 of the vertex @xmath200 is the length @xmath17 of the link between vertices @xmath201 and @xmath202 . \n since there is nothing to distinguish between different links , @xmath203 can be viewed as the probability distribution of the link length for large @xmath17 .    as can be seen from , for the tetrahedron \n the determinant contains short components to the fourth power , namely @xmath204 . \n we will show that this feature of the determinant is not particular to the tetrahedron , but appears in any needle - like configuration with an even number of vertices , whereas for any needle with an odd number of vertices we find eight short components . \n the reason for this lies in the dirac structure of the fermionic matrix .    to see this , \n let us define a matrix @xmath205 which for @xmath206 is equal to the fermionic matrix , @xmath207 . \n the matrices @xmath208 are antisymmetric @xmath209 matrices , @xmath210 . by construction , for needle  like configurations all elements of @xmath211 are linear in the long components @xmath17 , while those of the @xmath212 are linear in the short ones , @xmath213 . \n our aim is to prove that the leading term of the determinant @xmath214 is proportional to at least @xmath215 for even configurations and @xmath216 for odd , which is equivalent to saying that the leading term contains at least four / eight small components , which in turn gives @xmath217 and @xmath218 for even and odd configurations , respectively . \n we will use first order perturbation theory to show this . \n first of all , note that @xmath211 has at least one zero eigenvalue , because for strictly one - dimensional configurations with @xmath219 the action has an additional zero mode coming from invariance under a change @xmath220 . \n ( this is a discrete remnant of a more general invariance @xmath221 of the continuous action , with an arbitrary function @xmath222 . ) for the truncated matrix @xmath211 , this corresponds to a zero eigenvector @xmath223 thus , we also have @xmath224 , which already excludes terms of order @xmath225 . \n consider now separately the case of even @xmath68 . because @xmath211 has the zero eigenvector @xmath226 , @xmath227 has at least two eigenvectors @xmath228 and @xmath22 , which we can write as @xmath229 under a small perturbation @xmath230 the eigenvalues @xmath50 of @xmath227 are changed to @xmath231 . \n denote the first order correction to @xmath232 by @xmath233 . \n the determinant to this order is then proportional to @xmath234 , where the product runs over nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath235 . \n @xmath233 fulfills the equation @xmath236 which gives @xmath237 due to the antisymmetry of the @xmath212  : @xmath238 for any @xmath25 . \n thus , the eigenvalue @xmath232 remains intact to first order , which means that all terms of order @xmath239 likewise vanish in the determinant of @xmath240 . \n therefore , the leading terms must be at least of order @xmath215 . \n one can check that , generically , they are indeed of this order .    for odd @xmath68 , @xmath211 is an even by even antisymmetric matrix and , as such , can not have just one zero eigenvector but must have at least two , which we will call @xmath241 and @xmath226 . \n this in turn means that @xmath227 has at least four such eigenvectors , which we write as @xmath242 repeating the perturbation analysis in @xmath243 for the matrix @xmath240 , we find for the first order correction @xmath233  : @xmath244 ^ 2   = 0 \\ , .\\ ] ] we will now argue that all three terms in the sum vanish , and therefore @xmath237 . \n this follows from the peculiar structure of the matrices @xmath208 . as we know \n , their elements are linear in the components @xmath21 , and moreover all the matrices have the same structure . \n therefore , we can introduce a linear function @xmath245 such that @xmath246 . also , the eigenvector @xmath226 is likewise linear in @xmath21 , and we can again write @xmath247 . \n now we have @xmath248 ( in the first step , we just added @xmath249 ; in the second , we used the fact that @xmath250 ; and in the third , we used the linearity of @xmath245 and @xmath226 . ) \n thus , we have shown that there are still four zero eigenvalues even to first order of @xmath243 . as with \n even @xmath68 , we checked numerically that they are non - zero to the second order . \n thus , the leading term in this case behaves as @xmath216 . \n f. david ,  nucl . phys . \n * b257 * ( 1985 ) 45 ; + f. david ,  nucl . phys . \n * b257 * ( 1985 ) 543 ; + v.a . \n kazakov , i. kostov and a.a . \n migdal , phys . lett . \n * b157 * ( 1985 ) 295 ; + v.a . \n kazakov ,  phys . lett . \n * a119 * ( 1986 ) 140 ; + i.k . \n kostov ,  mod.phys.lett . * a4 * ( 1989 ) 217 . \n n. ishibashi , h. kawai , y. kitazawa and a. tsuchiya , nucl . \n * b498 * ( 1997 ) 467 ; + h. aoki , s. iso , h. kawai , y. kitazawa and a. tada , prog . \n * 99 * ( 1998 ) 713 . \n + h. aoki , s. iso , h. kawai , y. kitazawa , t. tada , a. tsuchiya , + prog . \n 134 ( 1999 ) 47 . \n w. krauth , h. nicolai and m. staudacher , phys.lett . \n * b431 * ( 1998 ) 31 ; + j. nishimura and g. vernizzi ,  jhep * 04 * ( 2000 ) 015 . \n + j. ambjrn , k.n . \n anagnostopoulos , w. bietenholz , t. hotta and j. nishimura ,   jhep * 07 * ( 2000 ) 011 ; + j. ambjrn , k.n . \n anagnostopoulos , w. bietenholz , t. hotta and j. nishimura ,   jhep * 07 * ( 2000 ) 013 .", "human_aspect": "{\n  \"background\": \"using the dynamical triangulation approach we perform a numerical study of a supersymmetric random surface model that corresponds to the large @xmath0 limit of the four dimensional version of the ikkt matrix model.\",\n  \"method\": \"\",\n  \"result\": \"we show that the addition of fermionic degrees of freedom suppresses the spiky world -

[ \n fig : net_arch ] ) . \n we create a binary mask of all the missing pixels to indicate their position to the network ( since zero can be a valid displacement value ) . \n it was shown by others  @xcite to enhance performance in deep neural networks for inpainting . \n the last input to the network is an edges map of one of the images in the image pair for which the flow is computed . \n the contours of an image was shown to be a key feature in image processing in the early visual cortex  @xcite . \n epicflow  @xcite already showed the benefit of the image edges as motion boundaries for optical flow estimation . in our work , we show evidence that a learning system also benefits from receiving the edges as input ( see fig .  [ \n fig : edges ] ) . \n we used an off - the - shelf edges detector - the `` structured edges detector '' ( sed )  @xcite - the same one used by epicflow . \n all the inputs are stacked together and downsampled by 8 to form an @xmath8 matrix . \n rather then a simple stacking , we also considered different ways of introducing the edges map into the network . among others , \n we have tried feeding the edges to all layers in the deep network , feeding the map to a different network and combining its output with the main branch in a deeper layer as well as constructing different networks to deal with pixels around the edges and far from the edges . \n however , we found that the simplest approach used here produced the best results . \n to optimize the network results , we used the epe ( end point error ) loss function , which is one of the standard error measures for optical flow . \n it is defined as the euclidean distance between two flow pixels : @xmath9 [ eq : epe ] the loss for an image pair was the average epe over pixels : @xmath10 [ eq : epe_loss]where @xmath11 is the network prediction , @xmath12 is the ground truth flow map and n is the number of pixels in the flow map . \n this standard loss by itself does not yield good enough results ( see sec . \n [ sec : exp_loss_var ] ) . we , therefore , resort to cortical neuronal filling - in processes in our search for better losses . \n neuronal filling - in is characterized by spatial spread of activation . \n there is evidence that the activation spread is mediated by both lateral and top - down connections . to imitate the lateral dependency between neighbors in the network , \n we define a new lateral dependency loss . \n this loss pushes the distance between neighboring pixels to be similar to the distance in the ground truth flow . \n it is defined in the following way : @xmath13 [ eq : lateral_lass ] the proposed loss term directly includes the local spatial dependencies within the training process similar to what happens in the early stages of the visual cortex  @xcite . \n top - down connections are tricky to implement in artificial neural networks . \n we , therefore , use the loss function , which is the main feedback to the network , to imitate top - down connections . \n also inspired by the evidence that neuronal filling - in takes place in many layers in the visual system hierarchy  @xcite , we used detour networks connecting each and every layer directly to the loss function .    during training , the loss function served as top down information pushing each layer to perform interpolation in the best possible manner . \n the detour networks were kept simple : aside from the main branch of the network , each of the layer s activations was transformed into a 2 channels flow map using a single convolution layer with linear activations ( no nonlinearity , see fig . \n [ fig : net_arch ] ) . \n each of the flow maps produced by the detour networks was compared to the ground truth flow map using the epe and ld losses . \n the final network loss was the weighted sum of all the losses : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the weight , epe loss and ld loss of layer l. we found that weights of 0.5 for each of the middle layers and 1 for the last yielded the best results . for inference , \n we use only the last detour layer output - the one connected to the last layer of the network s main branch . \n our approach has some similarities to the one used in the inception model introduced by szegedi et al . \n @xcite , which employs auxiliary networks with independent losses during training . \n they found it to provide regularization and combat the vanishing gradients problem . \n however , in their network , the first auxiliary network was added in the tenth layer . we found that adding a detour network for each layer gave the best results . \n szegedi et al.s auxiliary networks were also built of several layers and performed some computation within them . \n we found that the simplest linear convolution was the best architecture . \n additional layers or non - linearities did not improve the performance of the network .        taken together , our network was equipped with mechanisms with which it could imitate interpolation in the visual cortex . \n interestingly , not only did it learn to perform interpolation of regular motion , it also performed strikingly similar to the visual cortex when presented with an illusion . \n figure [ fig : kanizsa ] shows the interpolation applied by different variants of our network and epicflow on a given kanizsa like motion pattern . \n the network never saw such a pattern in training time . \n when masking parts of the image , our network interpolates the motion pattern from the background and the interior . the propagation from the background stops in the borders of the imaginary square contour ( marked by a dashed line ) much like our visual perception . \n importantly , only the real edges , not those of the imaginary contour , were fed to the network . \n other networks that were not equipped with all the tools we presented as well as epicflow performed different levels of a simpler interpolation . \n our fully convolution with zero padding and no pooling network produces an output in the same size of the input . \n we , therefore , upsample the output by a factor of 8 using bi - linear interpolation . like others before us  @xcite , we found that using the variational energy minimization post - processing used in epicflow  @xcite slightly improved our final prediction ( 0.25px . gain in mean epe ) . \n we employ the same parameters as epicflow , as appears in their section 4 . \n we report the results of our network on the sintel  @xcite , kitti 2012  @xcite and kitti 2015  @xcite datasets . \n we also show the effectiveness of different features in the network : the lateral dependency loss , the multi - layer loss and the edges input \n .      * preprocessing . * as described in section [ sec : net_arch ] , the network receives a 4 channel input composed of 2 sparse flow channels given as the output of a matching algorithm , a binary mask and the edges map . to reduce training time \n , we downsample all the inputs by 8 ( some matching algorithms output a downsampled version by default  @xcite ) . to reduce the number of missing pixels in training time we apply bidirectional averaging ( see supplementary ) . \n we apply flipping as our only data augmentation method . \n other transformations such as scaling , shearing , rotating and zooming did not improve the network performance , probably due to the interpolations that accompany them and drastically change the flow map . \n * datasets . * \n we evaluated our network on the three main optical flow benchmarks : mpi sintel @xcite is a collection of several scenes taken from a graphical animation movie . \n each scene consists of several consecutive frames for which a dense ground truth flow map is given ( a total of 1041 training image pairs ) . \n the scenes are diverse and include battle scenes with challenging large displacements . \n kitti 2012 @xcite is composed of real world images taken from a moving vehicle ( 194 training images ) . and kitti 2015 , \n @xcite is similar to the kitti 2012 dataset but with more challenging scenes ( 200 training images ) . \n since convolutional networks demand a large set of training data , we use the same approach used by dosovitskiy et al .  @xcite . for initial pre - training , \n we use the flying chairs dataset that they introduced . \n this is a relatively large synthetic dataset ( 22,875 image pairs ) composed of chair objects flying over different backgrounds . \n we train on all the dataset and use a sub - sample of the sintel dataset as validation . due to time constraints \n , we could not apply all matching algorithms to the big flying chairs dataset . \n we , therefore , used only flowfields  @xcite for this initial training on flying chairs . \n additional fine tuning was applied using the training sets of specific benchmarks and for the specific matching algorithm , see supplementary . in all presented experiments to follow , we pre - train the networks on flying chairs and fine tune on sintel using the flowfields matching algorithm - unless stated otherwise . \n all the analysis , results , and visualizations are done without the variational post - processing except for the benchmark results . \n * optimization . \n * we use adam  @xcite with standard parameters ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) . \n a learning rate of @xmath20 for the pre - training and @xmath21 for the fine tuning is used .      .comparing losses for the sintel final pass validation set , trained on the output of flowfields . \n [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we found that the training process results declined when the average number of missing pixels in the training flow maps was too high . \n some of the matching algorithms , in particular deepmatching , did produce sparse maps like these . to tackle this problem \n , we calculate the flow map bidirectionally ( from @xmath2 to @xmath3 and from @xmath3 to @xmath2 ) using the matching algorithm . \n we invert the second flow map and average the two maps . \n this simple step solves the sparseness problem for all of the matching algorithms we used . \n this procedure added to the computation time of our method . \n however most matching algorithms already compute bidirectional maps for consistency check and false matches filtering purposes and so we did not need to apply them twice . \n importantly , we found that the bidirectional averaging is critical mostly for training the network and specifically for deepmatching outputs . \n training on flowfields non averaged maps , for instance , gives comparable results to training with the averaged maps . \n interestingly , applying epicflow on the bidirectional average of the deepmatching algorithm output also slightly improved their results ( table [ tab : bidi_avg ] ) . for consistency reasons , \n we choose to present in this paper the results gained using the bidirectional averaged maps for training and evaluation . \n however , for all matching algorithms using only the original , non averaged map , in evaluation time yields results similar to those presented ( table [ tab : bidi_avg ] ) . \n the analysis in this section was performed without the variational post processing for both our method and epicflow . \n the validation sets for both kitti2012 and kitti2015 datasets were the last 20% of the pairs in each . \n for the sintel dataset , due to the temporal dependencies within scenes which are a pitfall for over - fitting , we define 4 whole scenes including 167 image pairs as a validation set rather than a random sample . \n we use the same validation set in the pre - training and sintel fine tuning phases . \n early stopping served as our only regularization method . \n the number of steps before performing the stop was 5000,1000 and 400 for training on the flying chairs , sintel and kitti datasets respectively . \n we use 4 rounds of early stopping in which we divide the learning rate by two starting with a learning rate of @xmath20 for the pre - training and @xmath21 for the fine tuning . \n after 4 rounds , we choose the weights that yielded the best performance on the validation set throughout the training . \n to further investigate our performance compared to epicflow , we looked at the epe over all noisy pixels ( pixels with @xmath22 ) and missing pixels from all the flow maps in the sintel validation set . to make a fair comparison for this analysis \n , we performed our prediction without bidirectional averaging so the number of noisy and missing pixels in the input to our network and epicflow was identical . \n we found that our performance were better than epicflow s in both of these areas , but it was significantly better only for the missing pixels ( @xmath23 difference between epic epe and our epe : @xmath24 , @xmath25 pixels ; paired t - test p=0.42 , @xmath26 for noisy and missing pixels respectively , n=167 ) . \n this emphasize our superiority over epicflow , especially in large missing regions , as was demonstrated in figure 5 of the main text . \n the supplemental figures presented here show further examples on top of the ones presented in the figures in the main text . \n figure [ fig : layers_supp ] shows the progression of the prediction process in the network as appears in the output of the different detour layers , similar to figure 3a in the main text . \n notice here also how the network first performs a simple interpolation and then refines the predictions in the deeper layers . \n figure [ fig : edges_supp ] presents the predictions of networks with and without the edges input , similar to figure 4a in the main text . \n the progression of the predictions in the different layers in those network is presented in figure [ fig : edges_layerssupp ] . \n these two figures illustrate how the edges input function in the network - acting as a stopper for spread of activation . \n notice how the bottom `` simple interpolation '' layers performs similarly in both networks . \n however , starting from layer 4 , the refinement process is very different . \n the network that receives the edges as input utilizes them to act as motion boundaries . \n finally , figures [ fig : epic_supp ] , [ fig : epic_kitti2012_supp ] and [ fig : epic_kitti2015_supp ] shows additional examples to the ones presented in figure 5 in the main text , for the comparison between the performance of our method and epicflow on the sintel , kitti 2012 and kitti 2015 validation sets .", "human_aspect": "{\n  \"background\": \"sparse -

These pillars are elongated structures that are commonly found near molecular clouds and are thought to be formed due to the interaction between the strong ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the stars and the surrounding molecular gas. The photoionization front driven by the UV radiation creates a stratified structure, with a thin layer of ionized gas, a dissociation front, and a molecular gas layer. The dynamics of these irradiated molecular clouds play a crucial role in star formation, and the outflow dynamics from the molecular cloud into the HII regions are of great interest. The pillars in M16, also known as the Eagle Nebula, are a well-known example of such structures. The orientation of this system and the temperature and ionized hydrogen number density in the HII region near the molecular cloud surface have been studied. The thickness of the photodissociation region is relatively thin due to the high optical depth provided by the large hydrogen number density. The velocity gradients along the long axes of the pillars have been measured, and the formation mechanism of pillars beside massive stars has been discussed by several authors. Two classes of models have been proposed: one is that the pillars are formed due to dense, pre-existing cores in the molecular cloud, and the other is that the pillars are caused by hydrodynamic instabilities. The latter model is based on the Rayleigh-Taylor instability occurring at the contact discontinuity between the dense molecular cloud and the lower density, hot, photoevaporated plasma. The time scale of the instability has been estimated to be less than 10^5 years. Observations of several nebulae have been studied, and the age of the pillars has been estimated using the Rayleigh-Taylor model, assuming small initial amplitude of the perturbations. Another type of instability, the ionization front instability, has been found to occur in the case of non-normal incident radiation, and a dispersion relation for perturbations growing by this process has been derived. Recombination plays a crucial role in the HII region, and its effect on the instability has been included in the analysis.", "gpt35": "This article discusses the shapes and formation mechanisms of the surfaces between molecular clouds and HII regions around massive stars.

The dynamics of irradiated molecular clouds are thought to play a role in star formation. The article also mentions specific observations of pillars in the Eagle Nebula and their velocity gradients.

known example is the eagle nebula which has three large , molecular pillars near a small group of o stars @xcite . \n although a number of theoretical and numerical studies have been done , the formation mechanism is still not fully understood . \n the ob stars are hot , with photospheres at temperature of a few tens of thousands of kelvins @xcite , and give off high intensity uv photons . \n these uv photons irradiate the molecular cloud which surrounds the ob stars and photoevaporation occurs , resulting in a stratified structure . \n the photoevaporative flow ( ablated plasma ) velocity is normal to the molecular surface @xcite . \n the region between the ob stars and the molecular cloud surface is the hii region in which the hydrogen gas is almost fully ionized and the photoionization and recombination to neutral atomic hydrogen occurs in steady state . \n the if is a very thin layer because of the short mean free path for the incident photons on the cloud surface . at this cloud surface \n all the photons above the lyman limit are absorbed . \n the photons below the ionization limit but above 11.2 ev can not ionize the hydrogen atom in the ground state but can penetrate the if and dissociate the molecular hydrogen in the underlying layers . \n the thickness of the dissociation front differs with each cloud . \n the last layer in the stratified structure is the molecular gas . because of strong radiative cooling , \n the molecular cloud temperature is typically a few tens of kelvin @xcite . \n the dynamics of such irradiated molecular clouds is thought to play a role in star formation @xcite . \n consequently , the outflow dynamics from the molecular cloud into the hii regions is of considerable , general interest @xcite . \n the pillars in m16 , popularly known as the eagle nebula , are at a distance of @xmath0 kpc ( @xcite ) . \n it is estimated that half of the ionizing radiation comes from a single o3 - 4 star and the rest mostly comes from the three other nearby stars ( o5 - 6 ) @xcite . \n the orientation of this system can be seen in fig . \n [ poundeagle ] ( taken from @xcite ) . \n the total ionizing flux is estimated to be @xmath1 . \n the temperature in the hii region near the molecular cloud surface is 9500  k and the ionized hydrogen number density is @xmath2 @xcite . \n the thickness of the photodissociation region ( pdr ) is relatively thin because the large hydrogen number density ( @xmath3 ) provides high optical depth . as measured by co line observations , the velocity gradients along the long axes of the pillars ( from `` head '' to `` tail '' ) are between -20.7 and + 6.7 @xmath4 , with an average magnitude of 8.3 @xmath4 . \n furthermore , the pillars are not in the same plane in the sky ; the differing signs of the velocity gradients indicate inclination towards ( positive gradient ) or away ( negative gradient ) from the observer . \n predictions of the classical rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability theory with regard to the velocity gradient @xcite are incompatible with the observed gradient , at least for constant acceleration @xcite . \n another formation mechanism should be considered . \n the formation mechanism of pillars beside massive stars has been discussed by a number of authors . \n there are two classes of models for their formation . \n one is that the pillars are formed due to dense , pre - existing cores in the molecular cloud ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in a interesting variation on this idea \n , @xcite also simulated the result of a radiatively driven , pre - existing , short pillar with the same density as the background molecular cloud ( their case ii ) . \n even in this case , the pillar grows . \n another possibility is that the pillars are caused by hydrodynamic instabilities . \n @xcite proposed a model based on the rt instability occurring at the contact discontinuity between the dense molecular cloud and the lower density , hot , photoevaporated plasma . \n he suggested that the pillars in the eagle nebula were the result from the nonlinear stage of the rt instability . \n @xcite estimated the time scale of the instability to be less than @xmath5 years . \n @xcite showed observations of several nebulae and estimated the age of the pillars by the rt model , assuming small initial amplitude of the perturbations . \n @xcite found another type of instability at the if in a non - accelerating frame , the so - called if instability , which , in his analysis , was present in the case of non - normal incident radiation . he derived a dispersion relation for perturbations growing by this process . \n @xcite extended it to include recombination , which plays a crucial role in the hii region . \n the recombination in the ionized gas works to smooth the surface when the wavelength of the perturbation is much larger than the recombination length . \n @xcite showed robust development of photoionized pillars with an isothermal model , although they considered a semi - infinite cloud and a non - accelerating if . \n @xcite derived a dispersion relation for the if with a non - normal incident radiation field including the effect of recombination in the ionized gas . \n @xcite found unstable modes with non - normal radiation for an accelerating if , but did not include recombination . \n most studies have assumed a semi - infinite molecular cloud and non - accelerating if . \n instabilities at an accelerating if were studied numerically by mizuta et al . \n ( 2005 , hereafter paper i ) . \n they show that , for imposed perturbations with small initial amplitude , i.e. in the linear regime , there was no significant growth \n . large growth of a classical rt instability is observed when recombination in the hii region is not included . \n we study here in more depth the dynamics of an accelerating if . \n the existence of the acceleration at the if is quite different than most previous models . \n this paper is organized as follows . the numerical method and conditions \n are described in sec . \n [ model ] . \n the results and discussions are given is sec . \n [ discussion ] , and the conclusion is given in sec [ conc ] . \n the same physics and computational method used in paper i are included in this study . \n the energy balance and magnetic pressure to prevent radiative collapse for the molecular cloud are considered . \n the equations we numerically solve are : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is mass density , @xmath8 is pressure , @xmath9 is unit tensor , is the velocity vector , and @xmath10 is the specific internal energy . \n the equations ( [ e -

[ e - eos ] ) includes a magnetic pressure term for dense gas to prevent radiative collapse @xcite , where @xmath23 is the ionization fraction , @xmath24 is the ionized hydrogen volume density , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are constant values . \n the index @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) is also constant . \n numerically , we do not take into account the atomic hydrogen state , assuming the dissociation front is thin as in the eagle nebula . \n equations ( [ e - fevolution ] ) and ( [ e - radtransport ] ) describe the evolution of @xmath29 and the transport of the incident radiation , where @xmath30 is the photoionization cross - section of hydrogen , and @xmath31 is the number flux of ionizing photons , i.e. , photons @xmath32 . \n since we use the `` on - the - spot approximation '' ( i.e. , photons emitted in recombination to ground state are immediately reabsorbed , whereas the photons emitted in recombination to second or higher levels are assumed to escape from the system ) , we do not consider the diffusive photon emission and transport . \n the 2d computational domain is ( @xmath33 ) = ( 0.46 pc@xmath343 pc ) . \n uniform grid points ( @xmath35 pc ) are used . \n periodic boundary conditions are employed ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 pc ) . \n the other boundary conditions are open boundary which means zero gradient . an incident photon flux ( @xmath38 ) \n is imposed from one boundary ( @xmath39 pc ) , where @xmath40 is the unit vector of the @xmath41 axis . \n the rays are parallel to the @xmath41 axis . \n a cloud of initial thickness of a quarter pc , and density of @xmath42 is set 0.5 pc away from the boundary where the incident photons come in . \n a very dilute gas @xmath43 is imposed in the other regions . \n initially , the gas at @xmath44 pc is in pressure equilibrium , and the gas at @xmath45 pc is isothermal ( 40 k ) . \n the constant parameters in the equation of state , such as , @xmath26 and @xmath25 , are the mass density and thermal pressure , of the initial molecular cloud , respectively . \n we impose the perturbation in the cloud in three different ways . \n the first is a density perturbation in a layer of 0.125  pc thickness along the surface of the cloud , with the form @xmath46)$ ] , where @xmath47 is the amplitude of the perturbation and @xmath48 . \n we assume a wavelength of @xmath49 pc , and consider amplitudes @xmath50 ( model d2 ) , 0.3 ( d3 ) , 0.4 ( d4 ) and 0.5 ( d5 ) . the second method is a 30% amplitude perturbation in the incident photon number flux of form @xmath51)$ ] , starting at 98 , 102 , 106 , or 108 kyr and ending at 110 kyr . \n these are models p098 , p102 , p106 , p108 , respectively . \n this is similar to the method used in paper i and in mizuta et al . \n ( 2005b ) . \n the third method is to impose surface perturbations on the initial cloud , according to @xmath52 $ ] . \n the amplitude ( @xmath53 ) is @xmath54 pc ( model s038 ) , @xmath55 pc ( s090 ) , @xmath56 pc ( s140 ) , and @xmath57 pc ( s190 ) . \n we briefly show the results without any perturbations , before showing the results with perturbations . \n the dynamics without any perturbation is very simple . when the incident photon flux is turned on \n , a shock propagates through the molecular cloud ( compression phase ) . after this \n shock breaks out of the back side of the cloud , a rarefaction passes back through the shocked cloud \n . then an acceleration phase begins at about @xmath58 kyr , as the cloud moves as a unit . \n figure [ 1d_1 ] shows one dimensional profiles of the hydrogen number density at the early phase of the dynamics at @xmath59 and 150 kyr . in the figure , \n all three phases are shown , although the phase at around @xmath58 kyr to @xmath60 kyr in which the rarefaction passes back through the compressed cloud is too short to show . \n the hydrogen number density profiles of an initially semi - infinite cloud are shown in fig . \n [ 1d_2 ] , both with and without magnetic pressure . \n the initial total pressure without the magnetic component is lower than with it . without magnetic pressure , \n the number density of the compressed cloud becomes about 1.5 times higher , since there is less pressure support . \n figure [ amp ] shows the evolution of the amplitude , i.e. , half the peak - to - valley of the perturbation of the @xmath61 contour in the @xmath41 direction for each case , for all three methods of imposing the perturbation . it should be noted that this does not always correspond to the amplitude of the perturbation on the cloud surface because of the effect of `` separation of the if '' discussed below . in cases with small initial perturbations ( models d2 , d3 , p106 , p108 , and s038 ) , \n the perturbation does not grow but rather oscillates as observed in paper i. this stabilization is caused by the density profile in the hii region . \n the ablated ( photoevaporated ) gas in the concave region of the incipient bubble concentrates ( gets weakly `` focused '' ) in the region above the bubble vertex . \n this concentration of gas subsequently absorbs more of the incoming ionizing photons , reducing the photon flux reaching the if region at the cloud surface near the bubble vertex , compared with the spike region . \n this is because the recombination rate depends on the square of the ionized hydrogen number density in the hii region . \n the net result is that the ablation pressure locally decreases in the bubble region compared to the spike region , which acts to smooth out the perturbed surface , if the perturbation is small . \n this is also shown in fig.[density]a with a 2d plot of number density late in time ( @xmath62 kyr ) for a small initial density perturbation ( model d2 ) . \n the if is quite smooth , namely , no growth of the perturbation has occurred . \n the other cases ( d3 , p106 , p108 , and s038 ) in which the perturbation does not grow behave similarly .      when the perturbation initial amplitude is larger , roughly when the ratio of the initial amplitude to wavelength is greater than 0.02 , the perturbations grow , after the acceleration phase begins at around @xmath58 kyr ( models d4 , d5 , p098 , p102 , s090 , s140 , and s190 ) . \n recombination in the hii region is included in all cases . here , we concentrate on the case with an imposed density perturbation ( model d5 ) to illustrate why the perturbation grows when the amplitude of the imposed perturbation exceeds a critical value \n .    figures [ density ] ( b)-(i ) show a series of the 2d hydrogen number density plots ( color ) with incident photon flux contours ( solid curves ) at different times . \n the high density regions correspond to molecular gas compressed by the ablation pressure . a typical hydrogen number density in the hii region near the if is @xmath63 as shown in figure [ 1d_1 ] . \n the solid white lines correspond to incident photon number contours from 0 to @xmath64 at intervals of @xmath65 , starting from the ionization front where the ionization fraction ( @xmath29 ) goes to zero . \n since we do not show the whole computational domain , all the photon flux contours are not shown in the figures in the later phases .    in fig.[density ] \n ( b ) , the photon flux contours near to the if are of the opposite phase as the if because of the oscillation of the if . \n this oscillation occurs by the stabilization mechanism seen in the linear regime ( paper i ) . in fig.[density ] ( c ) , the @xmath66 photon flux contour separates slightly from the highly compressed molecular cloud around @xmath67 pc , @xmath68 pc ( see also the close - up view in figure [ zoom ] ) . \n this is the separation of the if from the cloud surface . \n it happens because all the incident photons moving toward this region are absorbed by the recombined neutral hydrogen accumulated near the bubble vertex at @xmath67 pc . \n this could be understood as an extreme case of the normal stabilization mechanism of the if instability , because the increasing density around the cavity causes strong absorption of the incident photons . during the separation of the \n if , the cloud surface is shadowed . \n this shadowed region does not feel any ablation pressure because no absorption of the incident photons occur there , whereas the other parts of the cloud surface which are directly ablated by the incident photons feels strong ablation pressure . \n the region between the shadowed cloud surface and the separated if becomes neutral . \n the appearance of the neutral region happens because the timescale for recombination is roughly @xmath69 @xmath70 yr for ionized hydrogen at a number density of @xmath71 . \n thus , once the cloud surface is shadowed , the neutral region quickly appears close to the shadowed surface . \n we can identify this region as a warm hi region ( @xmath72 k ) because it has lost half of its thermal energy by recombination cooling . \n the pressure in this warm hi region is a few times smaller than that of the hii region and the molecular gas . \n this region has similar physical properties as the warm hi layer in front of pdrs described by @xcite ( see their figure 3 ) , which also arises due to a lowering of the ionization fraction . \n the appearance of this separation strongly affects the dynamics of the if . in reaction \n , the compressed cloud expands into the low pressure region , namely , in the @xmath41 direction , which triggers the second harmonic of the imposed initial perturbation in subsequent frames ( fig.[density](d ) - ( e ) ) . \n although the second harmonic of the imposed initial perturbation of the cloud surface can be clearly seen at @xmath73 kyr , the second photon contour ( @xmath74 ) from the if still shows just a single mode . in other words , the density around the side ( @xmath75 pc ) is high , and the density around the center ( @xmath67 ) is low , although both regions on the cloud surface are spikes . \n thus the stabilization mechanism seen in the linear regime ( paper i , and section  [ small ] ) does not work in this case . \n the ablation pressure is strong around the center ( @xmath67 pc ) , because the two last contours are close to each other there ( meaning the photon flux incident on the cloud surface is relatively high ) . as a result , \n a large amount of thermal energy is deposited there and compression by the strong ablation pressure occurs . \n by contrast , around the side ( @xmath75 pc ) the last two incident photon contours are separated from each other ( meaning a lower photon flux reaches the ablation front at the cloud surface ) . \n the resulting lower ablation pressure causes slight local expansion in the @xmath41 direction ( fig.[density ] ( e ) and ( f ) ) . \n this expansion allows the growth of the spike at the sides ( fig.[density ] ( g ) ) , and a strong second harmonic has grown up .    by 320 kyr , separation of the if from the ablation front ( cloud surface ) near the lateral boundaries has occurred ( fig.[density](h ) ) , and by 400 kyr ( fig.[density](i ) ) , this separation has also appeared near the middle . \n the net result is that the perturbation amplitudes at the center and lateral edges grow . \n once a critical amplitude is exceeded , at around 400 kyr , the stabilization mechanism is weakened by the steepness of the perturbations ( i.e. , the photon flux and therefore ablation rate along the steep sides of the perturbations drops , so there is much less density rise in the hii gas in the concave region ) , and the rt evolution proceeds rapidly into the deep nonlinear regime ( fig.[density](j ) ) .    for the other cases with a large amplitude of initial perturbations ( d4 , p098 , p102 , s090 , s140 , and s190 ) , we observe similar dynamics of the if and cloud surface \n the separation of the if occurs , a second harmonic of the imposed perturbation is triggered , and finally two pillars grow . \n the center panels of fig . [ resolution ] show a large perturbation growth in later phase of the dynamics using the different methods of the imposing the initial perturbation : density modulation ( model d5 ; top ) , perturbation in photon number flux ( model p102 ; middle ) , and surface perturbation ( model s090 ; bottom ) . \n the growth of the second harmonic mode of the perturbation is observed in all cases . \n figure [ velocity ] shows the @xmath41-component of the velocity in the pillar for an initial perturbation in density ( model d5 ) , in photon flux contour ( p102 ) , and in the surface ( s090 ) . \n the @xmath76 gradients are @xmath77 8.0 ( d5 ) , 16 ( p102 ) , and 12 ( s090 ) @xmath78 . in a real pillar \n , an observer would see any velocity gradient corresponding to @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the inclination angle of the pillar with the plane of the sky . \n indeed , @xcite measured such gradients in the pillars of the eagle nebula . \n this observed velocities in pillar ii of the eagle nebula are also plotted for comparison . \n for the purposes of the figure , we have taken @xmath81 degrees , dividing the observed values by @xmath82 . \n thus , for small inclination angles , our numerical results are good agreement with the observed pillar ii velocity gradient of @xmath83 ( @xcite ) . \n the calculation without the recombination effect , which was shown in paper i , shows a large growth of the imposed perturbation . \n the surface also shows growth of a shorter wavelength perturbation due to purely numerical reasons , such as less dissipation . \n it is impossible to impose exactly one single mode using cartesian coordinates ; small amplitude and short wavelength perturbations will also always be imposed . \n the wavelength of the short - wavelength `` noise '' which grows depends on the resolution of the calculation . to eliminate the possibility of this effect in the current calculations \n , we also performed the calculations with higher and lower resolution in the @xmath84 direction ; specifically , twice ( 384 ) and a half ( 96 ) the number grid points than in our standard calculation . \n figure [ resolution ] shows the results of higher ( right panels ) and lower ( left panels ) resolution calculations . as a reference , \n the results of the standard resolution calculation are also shown ( center ) . \n the results of the three different ways for imposing perturbations are shown ( top : @xmath62 kyr , 50% peturbation in density ; middle : @xmath85 kyr , 30% peturbation in photon number flux during 102 - 110 kyr ; bottom : @xmath62 kyr , surface perturbation of amplitude @xmath86 pc ) . \n the pillars appear and grow at all resolutions , differing only in fine - scale structure at the cloud surfaces . \n the separation of the ionization front is also observed at the early phase of the dynamics in each case . \n thus , we conclude that the pillar appearance is not a resolution - dependent effect .      that we produce pillars \n is purely the result of our periodic boundary conditions . unlike the pillars in our simulation , the eagle pillars are not co - planar and \n do not share the same inclination angle ( @xcite ) . \n they are effectively three isolated pillars , rather than a single structure . \n pillars in other hii regions are also typically isolated . \n however , our main aim in this paper has been to describe the instability of accelerating if , so we have assumed initially a single wavelength and periodic boundary conditions . \n we have chosen only one set of free parameters  the wavelength and number density , initial magnetic pressure of the initial cloud , incident photon number flux at the boundary , and thickness of the cloud  although these specific values match those of eagle nebula reasonably well . \n the main key to this instability is the mismatch of perturbation modes between the if and density in the hii region . \n the separation of the if from the cloud is the trigger for this mismatch . \n thus , it should still be possible to create an isolated pillar in the hii region under conditions where a single wavelength grows and becomes a pillar . \n different wavelengths and multiwavelength cases should be investigated , however , since the phenomenon relies on nonlinear dynamics . \n the effect of varying the magnetic field pressure should also be investigated , although the magnetic pressure is introduced just to prevent too high a number density from forming and does not affect the physical mechanism of the growth of the perturbation . \n an mhd calculation is one avenue for improvement over the current models .    in this study \n we have adopted the on - the - spot approximation which ignores the recombination of the ionized hydrogen to the ground state , assuming that the photon emitted by this recombination is absorbed locally because its energy is high enough to ionize another hydrogen atom . however , this approximation is not sufficient for cartesian calculations when the directions of if propagation and of the incident light rays become close to parallel . \n in such cases , irradiation by diffuse photons is the main source of ionization of the sides of the pillars . \n we expect to include this diffused photon transport in future calculations . \n we have investigated hydrodynamic instability of the accelerating if including detailed energy accounting . \n three different ways of imposing the initial perturbation were adopted : ( 1 ) perturbation in density : ( 2 ) perturbation in photon number flux : and ( 3 ) surface perturbation . \n we observe no large growth when the incident perturbation is small . \n this stabilization is the same as that observed in paper i , and identical to the stabilization mechanism theoretically found by @xcite for the non - accelerating if . \n the strong absorption of incident photons causes decreasing ablation pressure around the cavity , which effectively smooths out small amplitude perturbations . \n in contrast , large growth of the second harmonic of the imposed perturbation is observed when the initial perturbation is large , namely , the ratio of the initial amplitude to wavelength is greater than 0.02 . a slight separation of the if from the cloud surface triggers the appearance of a warm hi region and the appearance of a second harmonic of the imposed perturbation . \n the separation of the if from the cloud surface happens when all the incident photons traveling toward this region are absorbed by the recombined neutral hydrogen accumulated near the bubble vertex . \n the gas at this cloud surface at location begins to expand in the @xmath41 direction during the separation because the pressure in the warm hi region is less than that in other regions . \n although the second harmonic is imprinted on the cloud surface , the density perturbation and incident photon flux contours in the hii region are still single mode . \n the mismatch between modes at the cloud surface and in the density in the hii region above the cloud surface prevents stabilization and cause nonlinear dynamics of the molecular cloud . in the later phase of the dynamics , large growth of the perturbation \n is observed . \n this new result for the if instability does not depend on the method by which the initial perturbation is imposed . \n we also show that it is independent of the resolution of the calculation . \n the velocity gradient in the model pillar in the later phase of the dynamics is in good agreement with that observed in the eagle nebula . \n we would like to thank to takashi hosokawa , mark wolfire , nobuhiko izumi , and robin williams for useful discussions and comments . \n we acknowledge the anonymous referee for helpful comments which improved this manuscript . \n this work was performed under the auspices of the u.s . \n department of energy by the lawrence livermore national laboratory under contract no . \n w-7405-eng-48 and with support from nasa grant nra 00 -

elevation pointings over most of the frequency range . \n frequency range can be understood by noting that the collecting area of a dipole decreases as the square of frequency , whereas the galactic noise - dominated antenna temperature decreases with frequency at about the same rate . ] \n this corresponds to a @xmath12 sensitivity @xmath13  jy assuming both polarizations , 17  mhz bandwidth , and 25  ms integration \n .    a description of lwa1 early science results ( including first pulsar observations ) can be found in @xcite . to date \n lwa1 has detected 13 known pulsars and has several on - going programs dedicated to survey , monitoring , and characterization of pulsars @xcite . \n data for the present work were collected in 10 1-hr observations in fall 2012 , each centered on the transit of the crab pulsar , as detailed in table  [ tobs ] . in each observation , two beams were used together to track the pulsar ( i.e. , both beams pointing in precisely the same direction ) . \n the center frequencies of the passbands of the first beam were 76  mhz and 60  mhz , whereas the center frequencies for the second beam were 44  mhz and 28  mhz . \n since the usable bandwidth is @xmath14  mhz per passband , this scheme yields contiguous frequency coverage from 20  mhz to 84  mhz . \n the total volume of data collected in this fashion was @xmath15  tb ; relatively large since the data are recorded as raw voltage streams without channelization or other `` on the fly '' processing . \n this format provides the maximum flexibility for both initial processing and subsequent reprocessing of the data at later time using other search parameters or techniques . \n although the instrument is capable of tracking sources to very low elevation angles , we have restricted the observations to 1 hour each day around upper culmination in order to ( 1 ) limit the extent to which change in the beam characteristics over the track can manifest as variations in estimated flux density , ( 2 ) distribute the observations more evenly over the expected range of source conditions , and ( 3 ) reduce the tempo of data acquisition to a manageable pace . concerning ( 2 ) , a parameter of interest in the present work that is known to vary significantly over timescales of weeks to months is pulse broadening @xcite ; in fact , such variations can occur even on timescales of minutes @xcite . \n because this study involved the use of a new instrument and new data analysis procedures , we performed simultaneous observations of the bright pulsar b0329 + 54 using the remaining two beams , using the same synchronized - tracking four - passband scheme employed for crab gp observing . \n this allowed an independent check of the instrument and data reduction procedures using a well - known object , as well as providing an `` off pointing '' ( separated by @xmath16  h in right ascension ) for confirmation of crab gp detections as well as for identification of rfi through anticoincidence techniques . \n the data were analyzed using custom incoherent dedispersion software developed by one of us ( s.e . ) , designed specifically for rapid analysis of periodic and single - pulse emission of dispersed astrophysical signals in raw lwa1 beam data . \n the steps in data reduction for one passband of one beam were as follows : first , any samples having @xmath17 ( that is , the magnitude of the complex - valued sample equal to or greater than maximum encodable real or imaginary magnitude ) were assumed to be due to rfi and set to zero ; typically 0.1% to 1% of samples were zeroed in this process . \n next , data were partitioned into blocks of length @xmath18 ( center frequency - dependent ) and divided into channels using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) . \n values of @xmath18 and the associated time and frequency resolutions are shown in table  [ tfft ] . \n these values were chosen to make the residual dispersion negligible relative to the width of the scatter - broadened pulse after incoherent dedispersion . \n the raw linear polarizations were incoherently combined at this point . \n time - frequency pixels associated with the outer 10% of frequency channels were discarded and the inner 90% were `` flattened '' ; that is , variations in frequency and time ( attributable to the instrument or to ionospheric effects ) within the time span of the spectrogram ( typically 1050  s ) were removed . finally , all pixels in frequency bands containing persistent rfi , or rfi which was intermittent but frequently observed , were discarded ; additional details about this procedure are given in section  [ sigp ] . \n in addition to the amplitude variation , the ionosphere imparts both refraction and dispersion to received signals . for the purposes of the present work \n , these additional effects are negligible and may be safely ignored : the worst - case ionospheric refraction is on the order of arcminutes ( see e.g. @xcite ) and thus is a tiny fraction of the narrowest beam width in the present work . \n the worst - case ionospheric contribution to the total dispersive delay over 2084  mhz is @xmath19  ms @xcite , corresponding to an apparent error in dispersion measure ( dm ) @xmath20  pc  @xmath21 . \n this is at least two orders of magnitude less than the error in assumed dm used for dedispersion , which is described below and shown to be insignificant . \n following rfi mitigation , the result was incoherently dedispersed assuming dm @xmath22 56.791 pc  @xmath21 @xcite . \n although coherent dedispersion would be preferable from a sensitivity perspective , the residual dispersion after application of incoherent dedispersion at the time - frequency resolutions identified above is less than than the observed width of the scatter - broadened pulses by more than two orders of magnitude ; thus the penalty in the present work is negligible . \n in addition to having a large advantage in terms of computation burden , the frequency - domain interference mitigation procedure described below ( section  [ sigp ] ) is easily implemented in the incoherent dedispersion framework , but much less straightforward to implement as part of a coherent dedispersion scheme . \n the dedispersed time series was averaged to obtain an integration time and effective time resolution of approximately 25  ms for the 76  mhz and 60  mhz passbands , and either 33  ms or 50  ms for the 44  mhz and 28  mhz passbands . \n note that there is no subsequent adjustment to the assumed dm of 56.791  pc  @xmath21 in our processing . \n in particular , we did not perform a search over dm . as explained in section  [ spb ] , refinement of the dm \n used for dedispersion proves to be unnecessary because the resulting bias in estimated pulse parameters turns out to be negligible . \n the products saved from this procedure were ( 1 ) the dedispersed and averaged time series , and ( 2 ) the associated spectrogram , which was further averaged to a time - frequency resolution of approximately 5  khz @xmath4 100  ms . \n a representative spectrogram is shown in figure  [ fnicepulse ] . \n the spectrograms play an important role in data interpretation , as explained below .    in observing sessions where we simultaneously observed b0329 + 54 , we repeated the above procedure in all details , except for the dm ( 26.833  pc  @xmath21 ) and we took the additional step of folding the resulting time series at the known period ( @xmath23  s ) @xcite . in each case \n we detected the pulsar in all four passbands with high signal - to - noise ratio , giving confidence in the new instrumentation and data analysis procedures . \n furthermore we confirmed that gps detected in the beams pointing to b0531 + 21 were absent from the beams pointing to b0329 + 54 , as expected . \n traditional methods for identification of gps involve matched filtering of the time series , typically with iteration over dm in order to confirm that detected pulses are in fact crab gps . \n a straightforward application of this procedure is not robust for the present work , for several reasons . \n first , ionospheric scintillation results in variations that can vary by as much as 10% of the system temperature with characteristic time scales on the order of minutes . \n this frequently results in large variations in the noise baseline of the time series , and occurs on time scales roughly equal to or less than the time it takes for the `` chirp '' waveform of the dispersed pulse to traverse the passband . \n furthermore , gps in this frequency range remain scatter - broadened to durations on scales of 1001000  ms after dedispersion . \n this tends to make matched filter detection procedures that assume canonical pulse shapes with time - invariant noise baselines unreliable and frustrating to use , especially in the presence of impulsive rfi . \n furthermore , impulsive rfi is ubiquitous in this frequency range . in particular \n , we have found that signals from terrestrial television transmitters in the frequency range 5487 mhz are a serious problem . \n transmissions in both the modern digital `` atsc '' format currently in widespread use in the u.s . , as well as transmissions in the legacy analog `` ntsc '' format , are routinely found in lwa1 data . \n atsc signals are recognizable as emissions having 6 mhz instantaneous bandwidth , whereas ntsc signals are recognizable as relatively narrowband video and audio carriers separated by 4.5  mhz . with the exception of a persistent ntsc video carrier seen at 55.25  mhz ( associated with a station in mexico ) , \n these emissions are usually not seen as continuous transmissions , but rather in bursts with durations on the order of milliseconds to seconds . \n these bursts are believed to be due to reflections from ionized meteor trails and low earth orbiting satellites , as opposed to reflection from aircraft or the ionosphere . \n these emissions have two particularly irritating features from the perspective of searching for single dispersed pulses : ( 1 ) they frequently exhibit the same `` reverse ramp '' waveform expected of scatter - broadened pulses , and with similar durations , and ( 2 ) because they are narrowband relative to the overall bandwidth , they are often not significantly suppressed by the process of dedispersion  they are simply translated in time and ( in the case of atsc flares ) also `` smeared '' in time .    excluding bandwidths of 1.0 and 0.5  mhz around frequencies of ntsc video and audio carriers ( respectively ) \n dramatically improves  but does not eliminate  the ntsc problem . specifically , strong ntsc flares occasionally `` overrun '' the excluded frequency ranges . \n atsc flares can not be effectively mitigated by frequency blanking without removing the entire 6  mhz bandwidth of the emission . \n reducing the effect of ntsc and atsc flares to a negligible level by frequency - domain blanking requires eliminating an unacceptable amount of otherwise - usable bandwidth . \n because the flares occur with relatively small overall duty cycle , an automated joint time - frequency blanking scheme probably would be acceptable ; however , this requires significant software development and has not yet been implemented . \n at present , we find that the most practical and robust method for detection of crab gps in our frequency range is as follows : first , we manually search the spectrograms for each passband for the characteristic `` chirp '' of a crab gp which is visible over most of the passband . \n figure  [ fnicepulse ] shows an example . \n we then confirm the presence of the distinctive broadened pulse waveform at the appropriate time in the dedispersed time series . \n typically  but not always  pulses are first detected in the 76  mhz or 60  mhz passbands ; this is because the pulse broadening is less severe , and because pulse flux density in this range of frequencies generally increases with increasing frequency @xcite . \n the dedispersed time series for the other passbands is then also checked , accounting for the expected dispersion delay which is tens to hundreds of seconds due to the large fractional bandwidth between passbands . \n the first 10 or so gps that we detected using this approach were subsequently independently confirmed by repeating the procedure while sweeping in dm . \n we soon realized that that this computationally - expensive procedure was not necessary for the present work , since simpler procedure of detecting pulses through spectrograms and/or appearance in multiple passbands with the expected dispersion delay yielded a false alarm rate of zero , whereas the results of dm sweeps were frequently difficult to interpret due to the effects of the ionosphere and impulsive rfi , as discussed above . \n a possible disadvantage of this detection procedure is somewhat reduced sensitivity . \n manual inspection of dedispersed time series reveals many pulse candidates which are quite likely to be crab gps , but which are not visible in spectrograms and/or ambiguous or non - detections in the dedispersed time series for other passbands . \n we suspect refinements to the above procedures can increase the rate at which gps are detected by a factor of 23 at least . for this initial work , however , we prefer a simpler and more conservative approach . furthermore ( as discussed in section  [ spc ] ) , we shall apply an even more stringent criterion of s / n @xmath24 for the peak flux density . \n several candidate gps detected using the above procedure failed this criterion , indicating that the sensitivity penalty is actually not unusually severe in comparison to search procedures ( including fully - automated techniques ) employed by others ; e.g. @xcite and @xcite .    finally , we note that frequencies below 54  mhz down to the lowest frequency considered in this study ( @xmath25  mhz ) exhibit relatively sparse and low levels of anthropogenic rfi during local hours of darkness , when all of our observations were conducted . \n we found that no frequency blanking was required for the 28  mhz passband , and only 0.2  mhz was blanked in the 44  mhz passband ( to remove a persistent tone  possibly locally generated  at 48.0  mhz ) . \n ironically , ionospheric scintillation is significantly worse at the lower frequencies ; in some cases the resulting variations in the noise baseline were large enough to make characterization of the detected pulses intractable , and so these pulses were excluded . \n nevertheless it is believed that it is the low flux density of pulses relative to the system sensitivity , as opposed to the disposal of pulses distorted by baseline variations , that is primarily responsible for the relatively low rate of detections in the 28  mhz and 44  mhz passbands . \n below 84  mhz , the duration of crab gps is broadened by at least three orders of magnitude by scattering within the host nebula and along the line - of - sight through the ism . \n thus it is an excellent approximation to assume that the shape of the received pulse is simply a scaled replica of the scattering impulse response @xmath26 . \n appropriate pulse shapes are given by @xcite as follows : @xmath27 corresponding to scattering by a thin slab of material of infinite extent , and @xmath28 corresponding to scattering by material which is uniformly - distributed along the line of sight . in both forms \n @xmath29 is the unit step function ( @xmath30 for @xmath31 , @xmath32 for @xmath33 ; @xmath34 taken to be the pulse start time ) and @xmath35 is referred to as the _ characteristic broadening time_. the dependence of @xmath35 on frequency in the first form is determined by the spatial distribution of electron density . when this distribution follows the kolomogorov spectrum , @xmath36 , and early measurements seemed to indicate that this was the case @xcite . \n subsequent observations indicate a considerably more shallow dependence , with exponents in the range @xmath37 to @xmath38 @xcite . \n @xcite note that pulses observed in the 116174  mhz band are not well described by equation  [ eg1 ] , but obtain good fits to the modified form @xmath39 which includes a rounded leading edge with rise time determined by the parameter @xmath40 . \n we also find in the present work that the above form provides the best overall fit to the observed pulses , whereas the other forms generally do not ; thus we have adopted this model . as in @xcite , we constrain @xmath40 to be in the range 01 and find that this range seems to accommodate all pulses encountered . \n thus , each pulse in the present work is characterized by @xmath35 , @xmath40 , and amplitude . \n these are determined as follows : first , we fit a second - order polynomial to the time preceding the start of the pulse ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) in the dedispersed time series . \n the baseline variation is removed , and then an automated brute - force fit in three dimensions ( @xmath35 , @xmath40 , and amplitude ) is performed to find the least - squares fit to the data . \n figure  [ fpulsefit ] shows examples .    for verification , \n the model pulse is then subtracted from the data to confirm that the resulting time series is flat and free from artifacts . \n this turns out to be particularly important in our frequency range , since detectable pulses sometimes overlap each other and thus bias the estimation of parameters . in the present work , \n two otherwise - qualified pulses were excluded from consideration ( and thus do not appear in table  [ tobs ] ) for this reason . \n the amplitude of the pulse is characterized in two ways . \n first , the pulse peak s / n is calculated as the ratio of the peak value of the model pulse to the pre - pulse noise power @xmath41 . \n this is the value used in the @xmath42 detection criterion , described above . because the integration time @xmath43 ( 2550  ms ) is at least an order of magnitude less than the apparent width of the pulse , the _ effective _ \n s / n is much greater , and is given by @xmath44 \\sqrt{\\delta t/\\ w_{int } } \\label{esni}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the pulse energy , @xmath46 is the `` effective width '' of the pulse , and @xmath47 is the intrinsic pulse width , assumed to be @xmath48 @xcite . the effective width @xmath46 is the width of a rectangular pulse having the same peak amplitude and energy as the model pulse . for the form given in equation  [ emp ] , @xmath49 . \n note that the effective s / n can only be realized _ for detection _ by either optimal pulse - matched filtering or by deconvolution of @xmath26 from the intrinsic pulse shape @xcite . \n thus the estimated value obtained using the above procedure is used only for flux density calibration ( and not detection ) , as described in the next section . \n flux density calibration is challenging for array radio telescopes operating at low frequencies . \n the primary difficulty is that beam characteristics vary as a function of frequency and pointing relative to zenith , pointing relative to the celestial sphere ( because the system temperature may be dominated by sky noise ) , and source magnitudes can be modulated by as much as 10% due ionospheric scintillation . \n see @xcite for a discussion of these factors as they apply to lwa1 .    for the present work we used the transit drift scan sefd measurement procedure described in appendix  b of @xcite . in this procedure , the data are collected in exactly the same manner described in section  [ sdc ] with the exception that the beams are fixed , pointing at the point of upper culmination of the pulsar , and the total duration of the observation is 2  hours . \n the data are reduced to full - bandwidth total power ( single channel ) time series . \n the transit of tau  a ( the unresolved radio source which includes the crab pulsar and the surrounding nebula ) is clearly visible as a broad peak in the time series as the source moves through the main lobe . \n when the source is outside the main lobe , the time series is thus a representation of the system temperature of the instrument in the vicinity of , but excluding tau  a. the peak of the time series can thus be interpreted as the sum of the sefd and the flux density of tau  a. assuming the flux density of tau  a is known , the sefd can in principle be calculated from the ratio of the peak of the time series to the level of the flat , off - peak portion of the time series . in practice , we estimate and subtract a model of the beamshape , and use the level of the resulting noise baseline at the time of transit as the `` source turned off '' value ; this reduces the error associated with the gradual change in sefd over time .    in the present work we ignore the variation in beam characteristics with source position ( in particular , source elevation ) . since each observation is limited to 1  hour around upper culmination , this is variation is believed to be negligible . \n for example : assuming a @xmath50 dependence of beam directivity with zenith angle @xmath51 , the associated change of directivity over a 1  hour observation is less than 2% . \n the flux calibration procedure requires an accurate value for the flux density of tau  a over the range of frequencies considered . our model for the flux density of tau  a is @xmath52 \n the spectral index in this model is the one derived in @xcite . \n the reference flux density of 1944  jy at 76  mhz is the average of values extrapolated from measurements at 22.25  mhz and 81.5  mhz by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , using this spectral index . \n this model gives values which fall within the error bars of the 22.25  mhz and 81.5  mhz measurements ( @xmath53% and @xmath54% , respectively ) and turns out to be essentially the same as model used in recent work on crab gps at low frequencies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , attributed to @xcite , which uses the same spectral index but gives a 76  mhz flux density of 1915  jy . \n uncertainty in the reference flux density ( @xmath55% ) and the spectral index ( @xmath56 ) , together result in an uncertainty of about @xmath57% at 20  mhz relative to the 84  mhz value . in practice the model \n may also be biased at the lowest frequencies by factors not taken into account ; e.g. , turnover in the spectrum of the nebula .    using the above approach \n we obtain sefd of 13.7  kjy , 10.6  kjy , 10.3  kjy , and 11.5  kjy for the 76 , 60 , 44 , and 28  mhz passbands , respectively . \n the 76  mhz value is approximately twice the 74  mhz value reported in @xcite , which was obtained using essentially the same technique . \n the difference is due to a recalibration of the array beamforming delays which occurred before the observations reported here were started , and appears to have degraded the beamforming performance . \n no earlier measurements of the same pointing are available for the other passbands ; however the values reported above fall within the range 617  kjy that we normally expect for high - elevation sources \n . the clear presence of a peak at the expected time in the flux density calibration drift scans confirms pointing was working properly for all passbands during the observations .    from the above sefd \n estimates we find the @xmath42 sensitivities ( in terms of the effective s / n as described in the previous section , and not in terms of the peak waveform s / n ) are 656 , 515 , 444 , and 493  jy for the 76 , 60 , 44 , and 28  mhz passbands , respectively . \n these figures take into account frequency - domain blanking for rfi purposes , resulting in bandwidths of 14.07 , 13.64 , 17.44 , and 17.64  mhz for the 76 , 60 , 44 , and 28  mhz passbands , respectively . \n the observing sessions and the resulting detections are summarized in table  [ tobs ] . \n a total of 33 crab gps were identified in 10 hours of observation , distributed over 72 days during fall 2012 . \n one pulse was detected simultaneously in all 4 passbands , 21 pulses were detected simultaneously in 3 passbands , and an additional 11 pulses were detected simultaneously in 2 passbands . \n all but a handful of pulses detected passed the @xmath42 peak s / n criterion . \n traditionally , statistical distributions of pulse amplitudes are expressed as power law fits to the tail distributions of the corresponding probability distribution functions ( pdfs , or `` histograms '' ) ; see for example @xcite ; @xcite ; and + @xcite . \n this form of analysis is not meaningful for the present work due to the relatively small number of pulses detected . \n instead , figure  [ fcdfs ] summarizes detections as amplitude cumulative distribution functions ( cdfs ) ; i.e. , expected rates of detections for pulses @xmath58 a specified flux density . the cdf is the integral of the pdf ; however the tail distributions of the two functions are not related in a straightforward way . \n nevertheless for the purposes of pulse rate prediction in this and future work , a power law fit to cdfs shown in figure  [ fcdfs ] was done , with the following results : @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the number of pulses expected with flux density @xmath63 at @xmath64  mhz . \n ( no such characterization is possible for the 28  mhz passband , since one pulse was detected . ) \n note that the distributions exhibit very similar dependence on frequency , and may be steepening with increasing frequency . \n although these values can not be directly compared to analogous characterizations of the pdfs , we note that the same trend is seen in past work using the pdfs . \n figure  [ ffluxfreq ] shows the brightest pulses detected in each passband , the system sensitivity to crab gps ( worked out at the end of section  [ sfc ] ) , and predicted flux densities for detection rates of 1  pulse / hour using equations  [ en76][en44 ] . \n because the brightest pulses represent a undersampled tail distribution , it is not reasonable to infer a spectral index from our data alone . \n @xcite suggest a power law of @xmath65 for flux density from a two - point fit using the 23 and 200  mhz data . \n although the 174  mhz value from @xcite is for only 1  h , a model for the tail distribution of the pdf is also available ; this model predicts that the brightest pulse in 10  h ( for comparison with the present work ) is 10.5 kjy . \n this extrapolation combined with our data suggest that the dependence of flux density on frequency may be significantly less than @xmath66 . \n table  [ ttaud ] shows statistics of @xmath35 and the pulse rise time parameter @xmath40 for all pulses considered in the study . \n figure  [ ftd ] shows the statistics of @xmath35 in context with the analogous values for previous studies at other frequencies , which are also listed in table  [ ttaud ] . as explained in section  [ spc ] , \n the exponent @xmath67 of the power law dependence of @xmath35 with frequency is of particular interest as it is related to the distribution of the scattering material . \n table  [ ttaudpl ] shows @xmath67 calculated using various combinations of the data represented in figure  [ ftd ] and table  [ ttaud ] . \n data from our study seem to indicate that ( 1 ) @xmath35 is significantly higher than might be expected by extrapolation from other studies , and ( 2 ) the dependence on frequency is significantly weaker than might be expected by extrapolation from other studies .    with respect to the first finding \n , we have ruled out errors in assumed dm and residual dispersion ( due to the use of incoherent dedispersion ) ; we find that no combination of these mechanisms can account for a bias greater than about 35  ms in @xmath35 , which is less than 8% of the observed mean value for the highest - frequency passband . \n the largest contribution to this bias is 28  ms due to error in the assumed dm . \n this error is quantified as follows : the jodrell bank crab pulsar ephemerispulsar / crab.html ] @xcite indicates that the actual dm for the months of october 2012 through january 2013 was consistently higher than the assumed dm , with the worst case error being @xmath68  pc  @xmath21 larger than the assumed dm . \n this corresponds to an error in dispersive delay of about 636  ms over the entire frequency range 20 - 82 mhz . \n however we process this frequency span in separate 16 mhz passbands , and the worst case delay error across a passband is only about 109 ms ( in the 44  mhz passband ; it is worse in the 28  mhz passband but no pulse width measurements were obtained in that passband ) . \n the bias subsequently induced in the estimate of @xmath35 is only about one - fourth of 109  ms ( i.e. , 28  ms ) , which was determined as follows : we performed a simulation in which a pulse following the model of equation  [ emp ] with @xmath69 and @xmath35=978  ms ( mean values for pulses detected in the 44  mhz passband ) was `` smeared '' by an error of 109 ms in dispersive delay , and then we used our model - fitting algorithm to determine the apparent values of @xmath40 and @xmath35 . \n we find that the apparent value of @xmath40 ( as well as pulse amplitude ) is not significantly affected and that the apparent value of @xmath35 is high by about 28  ms . \n the excess delay and resulting bias in all passbands is shown in table  [ tfft ] . \n it is more likely that our data reflect actual changes in the distribution of ionized material within the nebula : the crab pulsar is known to exhibit increases in @xmath35 by factors of 210 for intervals on the order of days to months , attributable to ionized clouds or filaments within the nebula crossing the line of sight @xcite . \n this is consistent with the relatively high dm ( noted above ) in effect over the period of the observations . \n power laws in the form @xmath70 implied by our data are included in table  [ ttaudpl ] . \n recent studies ( summarized in this table and in table  [ ttaud ] ) have suggested that @xmath67 lies in the range @xmath37 to @xmath38 . \n this is not necessarily inconsistent with our data if we consider only the 76 and 60  mhz data . \n however our 44  mhz data imply a flattening in the dependence with decreasing frequency which does not appear to be consistent with @xmath71 . \n the weak dependence on @xmath35 on frequency implied by our data , like the large values of @xmath35 implied by our data , might be interpreted as a perturbation due to inhomogeneity in the distribution of ionized material within the nebula . @xcite \n have shown that inhomogeneities in the form of disks and filaments may lead to large variations in the dependence of @xmath35 on frequency , and that these effects may be particularly strong at low radio frequencies . \n given that the studies identified in table  [ ttaud ] and figure  [ ftd ] represent widely - separated epochs of scattering behavior within the nebula , it may be too much to expect a simple dependence of @xmath35 on frequency to emerge from these data . \n thus a broader interpretation of our findings may be simply that the frequency dependence is complex : neither static nor well - described by a single power law extending to low radio frequencies . in any event , our results , like those of other recent studies , strongly suggest that the electron density distribution is not in the form of a kolomogorov spectrum ( @xmath72 ) , and in fact @xmath67 ( to the extent that it is reasonable to characterize the frequency dependence of pulse broadening in this manner ) is probably always significantly greater than @xmath73 . \n we have demonstrated the ability of lwa1 to observe single crab gps over a frequency range of @xmath744:1 at a rate of @xmath75  h@xmath76 , yielding information about pulse amplitude and pulse broadening that may be useful in gaining insight into the nature of the crab gp emission mechanism as well as providing additional information about the electron density distribution within the nebula and along the line of sight . \n the key to continued progress is observing a far greater number of pulses distributed over a timeframe significantly greater than the weeks - to - months - long scattering epochs . to this end \n , we are continuing our program of crab gp observations with the goal of increasing the number of detections by an order of magnitude and then repeating the analysis presented above . \n also , we are preparing for simultaneous multiband observations of crab gps using lwa1 with instruments operating at higher frequencies , which may provide additional information on crab gp behavior by allowing us to simultaneously observe emission on both sides of the turnover in the gp spectrum . \n the authors acknowledge helpful discussions with w.a . \n coles , t.h . \n hankins , j.f . \n helmboldt , n.e . \n kassim , w.a . \n majid , and b.j . \n some of the data presented in this paper were processed using the lwa1 user computing facility , which is a joint project of the university of new mexico , virginia tech , and the jet propulsion laboratory and in which j. dowell was the primary contributor . \n basic research in astronomy at the naval research laboratory is supported by 6.1 base funding . \n construction of lwa1 was supported by the office of naval research under contract n00014 -

The neutron drip affects strongly the oscillation spectrum, which would give valuable information on the EOS in neutron star envelopes and global parameters of neutron stars if detected. The study uses the approximation of a plane-parallel layer and writes the space-time metric in the envelope as a locally flat metric. The pressure in the envelope is primarily determined by degenerate electrons and neutrons, and the linearized hydrodynamic equations are rewritten to study p-modes. The velocity potential can be presented in the form of an oscillation frequency and a spherical function. The unknown function obeys an equation, and the boundary condition at the stellar surface is imposed to localize oscillations in the envelope. The formal condition in the stellar interior should be imposed to localize oscillations in the envelope, and the actual variable is finite. The real depth of oscillation localization will be controlled in calculations. The EOS of matter in neutron star envelopes contains a sequence of first-order phase transitions associated with changes of nuclides with growing density, which are relatively weak. The paper extends the previous study of p-modes with high multipolarity localized in the outer envelope of neutron stars.

the dashed , dotted and dash - and - dot lines are for the hp , rhs and scm eoss of the ground - state matter . \n the different versions of the ground - state eos show approximately the same sound speed profiles , but the profile in the accreted envelope is significantly different . \n the depth of the accreted envelope ( up to the density @xmath74 g  @xmath12 , which is the largest density in the envelope , where the atomic nuclei are present , for the bps eos ) is @xmath75  m. for all models of the ground - state matter , the largest density in the envelope has been taken @xmath76  g  @xmath12 ; the envelope depth is @xmath77  m.      figures [ fig_omegaccreted ] and [ fig_omegground ] show squares of dimensionless eigenfrequencies @xmath78 versus multipolarity @xmath8 for accreted and ground - state envelopes of the canonical neutron star . because of the scaling ( [ scaling ] ) the figures can be easily transformed to a star with any gravity @xmath79 and radius @xmath4 by changing scale of the @xmath8 axis by a factor of @xmath80 .    for any envelope , the modes with @xmath81 can be subdivided into two groups , with a pronounced linear dependence and with a weak dependence of @xmath78 on @xmath8 . as will be shown in section [ subsec_eigenprofs ] , the modes of the first type ( _ the inner modes _ , shown by thicker lines in fig . \n [ fig_omegaccreted ] ) are localized in the vicinity of the neutron drip point , while the modes of the second type ( _ the outer modes _ ) are localized in the outer envelope . in figs . \n [ fig_omegaccreted ] and [ fig_omegground ] one can see a number of quasi - intersections . \n when passing through a quasi - intersection point ( with growing @xmath8 ) , an inner mode gains an additional radial node , but an outer mode loses one . \n let us consider the outer modes . \n the eigenfrequencies are the same ( within @xmath82 ) for all ground - state eoss ( see fig.[fig_omegground ] ) . for the accreted envelope , \n eigenfrequencies are larger because the eos is stiffer . with decreasing @xmath8 , \n oscillations penetrate deeper into the outer envelope , where the eos is softer because electrons become relativistic , and because they undergo beta - captures . \n it leads to a gradual decrease of @xmath78 . \n as in the model with the polytropic eos , given by eq . \n ( [ omegak ] ) , separations between squares of neighboring dimensionless eigenfrequencies @xmath78 are approximately constant for a fixed @xmath8 . the weak decrease of separations with the growth of @xmath50 is due to the penetration of oscillations into deeper layers of the star , where the eos is softer . \n the latter effect is more pronounced for the ground - state matter owing to a stronger softening of the eos . \n finally , at @xmath83 the outer p - modes are localized in the outer layers of the outer envelope , where the matter is composed of @xmath84fe nuclei for both accreted and ground - state eoss . \n accordingly , eigenfrequencies become nearly equal . \n naturally , the oscillation frequencies of outer modes with @xmath85 for the ground state envelope are the same as calculated by @xcite .    to demonstrate explicitly that inner modes are caused by the neutron drip in the inner envelope , in fig . \n [ fig_omegmodel ] we present eigenfrequencies for a model envelope without any neutron drip . here \n we employ the rhs eos in the outer envelope but assume that the inner envelope is composed of @xmath86se ions ( the last element at the outer envelope ) and electron gas ( no free neutrons ) . \n the oscillation spectrum does not contain any inner modes . a small decrease of @xmath78 for @xmath87 is produced by the softening of the eos at the bottom of the outer envelope . \n the growth of frequencies at @xmath88 is caused by the penetration of oscillations into the inner envelope , where our model eos is polytropic ( with the index @xmath89 ) . \n accordingly , oscillation frequencies tend to the values provided by the polytropic model ( [ omegak ] ) . \n if detected , outer modes would give us @xmath90 , and therefore @xmath91 ; see eq . \n ( [ omega0_dist ] ) \n . a detection of the only one fundamental mode ( @xmath44 ) would be sufficient to determine @xmath91 . \n a detection of several outer modes ( with different @xmath8 and/or @xmath50 ) would confirm and strengthen this determination . \n our calculations show that for the inner modes the ratio @xmath92 is a linear function of @xmath8 . using the scaling relation ( [ scaling ] ) we can present this linear dependence in the form @xmath93 here , @xmath94 is the surface gravity in units @xmath95  cm  s@xmath66 , @xmath96 cm=@xmath97 km , while @xmath98 and @xmath99 are dimensionless constants determined by the eos in a neutron star envelope .    for the canonical neutron star with the ground - state envelope , we obtain @xmath100 and @xmath101 in the case of inner modes with lowest frequencies . for the same star with the accreted crust we have @xmath102 and @xmath103 . \n the values of @xmath104 allow us to determine @xmath99 . in this way we obtain @xmath105 \n hence , the difference between the ground - state and accretion envelopes is quite pronounced in oscillation spectra . \n therefore , if several ( minimum two ) inner modes could be detected in addition to outer modes , their frequencies could be fitted by a function ( [ innfit ] ) and the values of @xmath98 and @xmath104 could be determined . \n an accurate determination of @xmath98 would enable one to distinguish between the ground - state and accretion envelopes . \n the value of @xmath104 would give then @xmath106 . combining this @xmath106 with the value @xmath107 , determined from the detection of the outer modes , \n one would get a simple system of two equations for two unknowns , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . \n thus , a detection of one outer mode and several inner ones could in principle enable one to discriminate between the ground - state and accreted envelopes and determine neutron star mass and radius . \n figures [ fig_eigenaccrl100][fig_eigengrounl500 ] show profiles of the angle - averaged energy density of oscillations as a function of @xmath15 . \n the root - mean - square amplitude of radial displacements of the stellar surface has been set equal to 1  m. the subscript of @xmath108 indicates the number of radial nodes . \n the vertical dotted line marks the boundary between the inner and outer envelopes ( @xmath109  m for the accreted envelope , and @xmath110  m for all ground - state envelopes of the canonical neutron star ) . \n figure [ fig_eigenaccrl100 ] depicts eigenmodes with @xmath111 for the accreted envelope . \n the modes are spread over the entire envelope ; their subdivision into the outer and inner modes is not obvious . \n however , some traces of two mode types are visible . \n the mode with one radial node ( the dashed line ) , whose frequency belongs to the branch of the outer modes , is primarily localized in the vicinity of the neutron drip point . \n however , other modes do not demonstrate this feature . \n the effects of phase transitions are relatively small ( @xmath112% ) and only slightly noticeable in figure [ fig_eigenaccrl100 ] . \n they are local and do not change global ( on scales of @xmath113  m ) energy density profiles . \n figure [ fig_eigenaccrl400 ] shows eigenmodes with @xmath114 for the accreted envelope . \n this value of @xmath8 is very close to the quasi - intersection point for the modes with 4 and 5 radial nodes ( see fig .  [ fig_omegaccreted ] ) . \n the subdivision into the outer and inner modes is clear  the modes with @xmath1150 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 radial nodes are localized in the outer envelope , but the energy of the mode with @xmath1154 is concentrated in the outer part of the inner envelope . \n this subdivision is the same as in section [ subsec_eigenfrec ] ( see figure [ fig_omegaccreted ] ) . \n the energy - density profiles of the fourth and fifth modes are very similar at @xmath116  m , but at @xmath117  m the energy densities differ by more than two orders of magnitude ! the outer modes feel the lowering of the sound speed in the outer layers of the inner envelope ( see fig .  [ fig_cs2 ] ) and increase their energy density in this region . however , the increase is not so large as for the inner modes . \n the signatures of phase transitions are very small ( @xmath118% ) and hardly visible in figure [ fig_eigenaccrl400 ] . \n they are local and do not change energy density profiles on scales @xmath113  m.    figures [ fig_eigengrounl100 ] and [ fig_eigengrounl500 ] are plotted for the ground - state envelope with the rhs eos . \n the results for the hp and scm are qualitatively the same . \n figure [ fig_eigengrounl100 ] depicts eigenmodes with @xmath111 . \n the modes are localized in the entire envelope and can not be subdivided into the outer and inner ones . \n the traces of these two types of modes are weaker than for the accreted envelope ( see fig.[fig_eigenaccrl100 ] ) . \n the signatures of phase transitions in the outer envelope are small @xmath119% and have scales @xmath120  m. they are noticeable only for the modes with a few number of radial nodes . \n many modes show large ( @xmath121% ) jumps of the energy density at the neutron drip point . \n figure [ fig_eigengrounl500 ] shows eigenmodes with @xmath122 . \n this value of @xmath8 is close to the quasi - intersection point for modes with @xmath1152 and 3 and with @xmath1155 and 6 ( see fig .  [ fig_omegground ] ) . \n the modes can obviously be subdivided to the two types . \n the modes with @xmath1150 , 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 are localized in the outer envelope ; the energy of the modes with @xmath1152 and 6 is concentrated near the neutron drip point . \n the subdivision of modes is the same as suggested in section [ subsec_eigenfrec ] on the basis of figure [ fig_omegground ] . \n the energy profiles of the second and third modes are very close for @xmath123  m , but for @xmath124  m the energy density differs by more than three orders of magnitude . \n qualitatively the same feature is demonstrated by the fifth and sixth modes . \n the outer modes ` respond ' to the lowering of the sound speed after the neutron drip point by increasing the energy density in this region . this increase is greater for the second and fifth modes whose frequencies are close to the frequencies of the inner modes . \n however , it is not so large as for the inner modes . \n the signatures of phase transitions in the outer envelope are extremely small ( @xmath125% ) and are almost invisible in figure [ fig_eigengrounl500 ] . \n the scales of such features are @xmath126  m. the large phase transition at the neutron drip point produces the signature with the same properties . \n we have studied high - frequency pressure oscillations which are localized in the envelopes of neutron stars composed of the accreted or ground - state matter . \n our main conclusions are as follows . \n \\(1 ) the oscillations are almost insensitive to various modifications of the eos for the ground - state matter ( section [ subsec_eigenfrec ] ) . \n all eoss we have used ( hp , rhs , scm ) give the same oscillation spectrum . \n \\(2 ) the neutron drip and associated softening of the eos in the inner envelope do not affect strongly the spectrum of the well known ( outer ) oscillation modes which are localized predominantly in the outer envelope ( section [ subsec_eigenfrec ] ) . \n \\(3 ) however , the neutron drip leads to the appearance of inner oscillation modes localized mostly near the neutron drip point ( section [ secres ] ) . \n the spectrum of these modes is sensitive to the eos in the envelope ( accreted or ground - state ) . \n \\(4 ) the p - mode oscillation problem is self - similar ( in the plane - parallel approximation ) . \n once the problem is solved for one stellar model , it can easily be rescaled to neutron star models with any mass and radius ( but the same eos in the envelope ; see section [ subsecmodescale ] ) . \n \\(5 ) a detection and identification of one outer mode and several inner modes would enable one to discriminate between the ground - state and accreted envelope and determine neutron star mass and radius ( section [ sect : infer ] ) . \n for example , a detection of the fundamental mode with @xmath127 at the frequency 74 khz and of two inner modes with @xmath128 and @xmath127 at 56 khz and 140 khz , respectively , would indicate a canonical neutron star with the ground - state envelope .    therefore , high - frequency pressure modes are excellent tools to explore the physics of matter in neutron star envelopes and to determine masses and radii of neutron stars \n . the oscillation frequencies could be detected by radio - astronomical methods very precisely . \n a detailed analysis of pulse shapes of some radio pulsars reveals that oscillations with large multipolarity are possibly excited there @xcite but their frequencies are @xmath12930 hz , so that they are not high - frequency p - modes we discuss here .    a search for high - frequency p - modes could be useful . \n high - multipolarity p - modes do not damp very quickly because they do not produce any powerful gravitational or electromagnetic emission ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? \n they are robust because they are relatively independent of the thermal state of the star , and they should not be strongly affected by neutron star magnetic fields . \n the inner p - modes , localized in the inner envelope , could be easily triggered by pulsar glitches , which are thought to occur just in inner envelopes of pulsars . \n @xcite studied the dissipation of p - modes localized in the outer envelope ; this dissipation is mainly produced by the shear viscosity . \n it may be enhanced by thin viscous layers near numerous nuclear phase transitions . \n the viscosity in these layers can be diffusive or turbulent . \n note , that fundamental modes do not produce viscosity layers because they pass phase transitions without velocity discontinuities ( see sec . \n [ secformal ] ) . \n their dissipation is not enhanced by phase transitions . \n finally , p - modes in neutron star envelopes are relatively insensitive to the eos and composition of neutron star cores \n . however , these modes can be useful to discriminate between ordinary neutron stars and strange stars with crust . \n the latter stars are thought to contain extended cores composed of strange quark matter . \n nevertheless , a core is assumed to be surrounded by an envelope of normal matter ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ) , so that a strange star with the crust may look like an ordinary neutron star from outside . the density of the normal matter in a strange star does not exceed the neutron drip density . \n the pressure modes in the envelopes of such stars should easily ` feel ' underlying dense quark matter , and the oscillation spectrum would reflect the presence of the quark core . \n we intend to consider this effect in a future publication . \n i am grateful to d.g . \n yakovlev for discussions . \n this work was supported by a grant of the  dynasty  foundation and the international center for fundamental physics in moscow , by the russian foundation for basic research ( project no . \n 05 - 02 - 16245 ) , and by the program of support for leading scientific schools of russia ( nsh-1115.2003.2 ) .", "human_aspect": "{\n  \"background\": \"we study eigenmodes of acoustic oscillations of high multipolarity @xmath0 @xmath1 and high frequency ( @xmath2 khz ), localized in neutron star envelopes.\",\n  \"method\": \"once the oscillation spectrum is calculated for a given equation of state (eos) in the envelope and given stellar mass @xmath3 and radius @xmath4, it can be rescaled to a star with any @xmath3 and @xmath4 (but the same eos in the envelope).\",\n  \"result\": \"we calculate oscillation spectra for the eoss of cold - catalyzed and accreted matter and show that the spectra of the inner modes are essentially different.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"a detection and identification of high - frequency pressure modes would allow one to infer @xmath3 and @xmath4 and determine also the eos in the envelope (accreted or ground - state) providing thus a new and simple method to explore the main parameters and internal structure of neutron stars.\"\n}", "gpt35_aspect": "{\n  \"background\": \"Neutron stars are resonators that can be used to study their internal structure.

diversification and intensification . \n the balance between these components are very important to ensure the good performance of an algorithm @xcite . \n in other words , a good degree of diversity should be maintained in the population of the solutions so that exploration and exploitation can be reflected in the evolving population . \n if the population is too diverse , it is good for global exploration , but it may slow down the convergence . \n on the other hand , if the diversity is too low , intensive local exploitation may lead to premature convergence , and thus may loose the opportunity of finding the global optimality . \n however , how to maintain good balance is still an unsolved problem , and different algorithms may have different ways of dealing with this issue .    in most algorithms such as the particle swarm optimization , exploration and diversity can be considered as the steps by using random numbers , while intensification and exploitation are by the use of current global best . however , there is no direct control on how to switch between these components . even in the accelerated particle swarm optimization ( aspo ) , diversity \n is mainly controlled by a random - walk - like term , while the control is indirectly carried out by an annealing - like reduction of randomness . on the other hand , eagle strategy provides a direct control of these two stages / steps in an iterative manner . \n first , solutions are sampled in a larger search space , and these solutions often have high diversity . \n these solutions are then fed into the apso for evolution so that a converged state can be reached , and at the converged state , solution diversity is low . \n then , a new set of samples are drawn again from the larger search space for another round of intensive apso iteration stage . in this way \n , both exploration and exploitation have been used to main a good degree of diversity in the overall population , which also allows the system to converge periodically towards global optimality . \n as we will see in the late analysis of random walks and search strategies , randomization techniques are often used for exploration to increase the diversity of the solutions , while the selection of good solutions and evolution of an algorithm tend to lead to convergence of the system . however \n , their role is subtle . \n for example , in memetic algorithms , the balance is even more subtle @xcite . \n it can be expected that the analysis in the rest of the paper can provide some insight into the working mechanisms and subtlety of random walks and randomization techniques in maintaining the good diversity of solutions in different algorithms . \n in modern stochastic optimization algorithms , especially those based on swarm intelligence , there are often a deterministic component and a stochastic component , though traditional algorithms such as the steepest descent method are purely deterministic . \n randomness is now an essential part of the stochastic search algorithms . \n randomization techniques such as random walks have become an integrated part of a search process in stochastic algorithms . \n however , how to achieve the effective randomization remains an open question . \n the exact form of randomization may depend on the actual algorithm of interest . \n one of the objective of this paper is to analyze and discuss the main concepts of random walks and lvy flights , and their role in metaheuristic optimization . \n in essence , a stochastic search process involves the use of a random process to generate new solutions in the search space so that the solutions can sample the landscape appropriately . \n however , the effectiveness of this sampling process depends on the random process used and the actual way of generating new solutions / samples . \n if the search space is treated as a black box ( thus no knowledge or assumption about the modality is made ) , a random walk is one of the most simplest ways to carry out the search for optimality . briefly speaking , \n a random walk is a random process which consists of taking a series of consecutive random steps @xcite . \n that is , the total moves @xmath19 after @xmath20 steps are the sum of each consecutive random step @xmath21 : s_n=_i=1^n x_i = x_1 + ... + x_n = _ \n i=1^n-1 x_i + x_n = s_n-1 + x_n , where @xmath22 is a random step drawn from a random distribution such as a normal distribution . depending on the perspective \n , the above relationship can also be considered as a recursive formula . \n that is , the next state @xmath19 will only depend on the current existing state @xmath23 and the move or transition @xmath24 from the existing state to the next state . \n in other words , the next state will depend only on the current state and the transition probability , and it has no direct link to the states in the past . from the markov theory , we know that this is typically the main property of a markov chain , to be introduced later .    it is worth pointing out that there is no specific restriction on the step sizes . \n in fact , the step size or length in a random walk can be fixed or varying . \n random walks have many applications in physics , economics , statistics , computer sciences , environmental science and engineering . mathematically speaking , a random walk can be defined as s_t+1= s_t + w_t , where @xmath25 is the current location or state at @xmath5 , and @xmath26 is a step or random variable drawn from a known probability distribution . \n if each step or jump is carried out in the @xmath27-dimensional space , the random walk @xmath19 discussed earlier becomes a random walk in higher dimensions . \n in addition , there is no reason why the step length should be fixed . in general \n , the step size can also vary according to a known distribution . \n if the step length obeys the gaussian distribution , the random walk becomes the brownian motion or a diffusion process . \n as the number of steps @xmath20 increases , the central limit theorem implies that the random walk should approach a gaussian distribution . \n if the steps are drawn from a normal distribution with zero mean , the mean of particle locations is obviously zero . \n however , their variance will increase linearly with @xmath5 . \n this is valid for the case without any drift velocity .    in a more generalized case in the @xmath27-dimensional space , the variance of brownian \n random walks can be written as ^2(t ) = |v_0|^2 t^2 + ( 2 d d ) t , where @xmath28 is the drift velocity of the system @xcite . here \n @xmath29 is the effective diffusion coefficient which is related to the step length @xmath30 over a short time interval @xmath31 during each jump . for example , the well - known brownian motion @xmath32 obeys a gaussian distribution with zero mean and time - dependent variance : b(t ) ~n(0 , ^2(t ) ) , where @xmath33 means the random variance obeys the distribution on the right - hand side ; that is , samples should be drawn from the distribution .    in physics and chemistry , \n a diffusion process can be considered as a series of brownian motion , which obeys the gaussian distribution . \n therefore , standard diffusion is often referred to as the gaussian diffusion . \n if the motion at each step is not gaussian , then the diffusion is called non - gaussian diffusion . on the other hand , \n if the step lengths are drawn from other distributions , we have to deal with more generalized random walks . \n for example , a very special case is when step lengths obey the lvy distribution , such a random walk is called lvy flight or lvy walk @xcite . \n it is worth pointing out that a lvy flight is also a markov chain . \n in fact , any algorithmic path traced by the current solution plus a transition probability forms a markov chain . \n this is one of the reason why markov chain theory can be used to analyzed stochastic algorithms such as simulated annealing and cuckoo search .    in section 4 \n , we will discuss random walks without drift . \n that is , we will set @xmath34 .      in standard gaussian random walks , \n the steps are drawn from a gaussian normal distribution @xmath35 , and these steps are mostly limited within @xmath36 . therefore , it can be expected that very large steps ( @xmath37 ) are extremely rarely . \n sometimes , it may be necessary to generate new solutions that are far from the current state so as to avoid being trapped in a local region for a long time . in this case , \n random walks with varying step sizes may be desirable . \n for example , lvy flights are another class of random walks whose step lengths are drawn from the so - called lvy distribution . \n when steps are large , lvy distribution can be approximated as a simple power - law l(s ) ~|s|^-1- , where @xmath38 is an index @xcite . \n however , this power - law is just an approximation to the lvy distribution .    to be more accurate \n , lvy distribution should be defined in terms of the following fourier transform f(k)= , 0 < 2 , where @xmath39 is a scaling parameter . in general , the inverse of this integral is not straightforward , as no analytical form can be obtained , except for a few special cases . \n one special case @xmath40 corresponds to a gaussian distribution , and another case @xmath41 leads to a cauchy distribution . \n though the inverse integral is difficult , however , one useful technique is to approximate l(s ) = _ 0^ ( k s ) dk , when @xmath30 is large . \n that is , l(s ) , s , where the gamma function @xmath42 is defined as ( z ) = _ \n 0^ t^z-1 e^-t dt . \n obviously , when @xmath43 is an integer , it becomes @xmath44 . \n since the steps drawn from a lvy distribution can be occasionally very large , random walks in terms of lvy flights are more efficient than standard brownian random walks . \n it can be expected that lvy flights are efficient in exploring unknown , large - scale search space . \n there are many reasons to explain this high efficiency , and one reason is that the variance of lvy flights ^2(t ) ~t^3- , 1 2 , increases much faster than the linear relationship ( i.e. , @xmath45 ) of brownian random walks . \n it is worth pointing out that a power - law distribution is often linked to some scale - free characteristics , and lvy flights can thus show self - similarity and fractal behavior in the flight patterns . \n studies show that lvy flights can maximize the efficiency of the resource search process in uncertain environments . \n in fact , lvy flights have been observed among the foraging patterns of albatrosses , fruit flies , and spider monkeys . \n even humans such as the ju/hoansi hunter - gatherers can trace paths of lvy - flight patterns @xcite . in addition , \n lvy flights have many applications . \n many physical phenomena such as the diffusion of fluorenscent molecules , cooling behavior and noise could show lvy - flight characteristics under right conditions . \n lvy flights have been successfully used in optimization to enhance the search efficiency of nature - inspired algorithms @xcite . \n the above nonlinear variance partly explain why . as we will see below , a good combination with other methods such as eagle strategy \n can be even more efficient . \n if we look at an algorithm from the markovian view , an algorithm is intrinsically related to markov chains because an algorithm is an iterative procedure whose aim is to generate new , better solutions from the current solution set so that the best solution can be reached in a finite number of steps , ideally , as fewer steps as possible . in this sense , the next solutions ( i.e. , states ) can depend only on the current solution ( states ) and the way to move ( the transition ) towards the new solution ( i.e. , new states ) \n therefore , the solution paths are markov chains .    in the very simplest case , \n a very good example is the so - called simulated annealing @xcite , which is a markov chain generating a piece - wise path in the search space . broadly speaking , \n swarm - intelligence - based algorithms such as particle swarm optimization , bat algorithm and eagle strategy can all be considered as a system of multiple interacting markov chains @xcite . \n now , let us discuss these concepts in detail \n .    briefly speaking , a random variable @xmath46 is said to form a markov process if the transition probability , from state @xmath47 at time @xmath5 to another state @xmath48 , depends only on the current state @xmath49 , independent of any past states before @xmath5 . \n mathematically , we have p(i , j ) p(u_t+1=s_j|u_0=s_p , ... , u_t = s_i ) = p(u_t+1=s_j|u_t = s_i ) , which is independent of the states before @xmath5 . the sequence of random variables @xmath50 generated by a markov process \n is subsequently called a markov chain . obviously , a random walk is a markov chain . \n the transition probability p(i , j ) p ( i j)=p_ij , is also called the transition kernel of the markov chain . from the algorithmic point of view \n , different algorithms will have different transition kernel ; however , it is not known what kernels are most effective for a given problem . in order to solve an optimization problem , \n the feasible solution set can be obtained by performing a random walk , starting from a good initial but random guess solution . however , simple or blind random walks are not efficient .    to be computationally efficient and effective in searching for \n new solutions , effective transition kernels should allow to generate new solutions near the truly optimal solutions as well as to increase the mobility of the random walk so as to explore the search space more effectively . \n in addition , the best solutions found so far should be kept in the population . \n ideally , the way to control the walk should be carried out in such a way that it can move towards the optimal solutions more quickly , rather than wandering away from the potential best solutions . \n these are the challenges for most metaheuristic algorithms , and various attempts are being made so as to design better optimization algorithms . \n in all metaheuristic algorithms , different forms of random walks are widely used for randomization and local search @xcite . \n obviously , a proper step size is very important . \n many algorithms typically use the following generic equation : ^t+1=^t + s * * _ t , where @xmath51 is drawn from a standard normal distribution with zero mean and unity standard deviation . here \n , the step size @xmath30 is essentially a scaling factor , controlling how far a random walker , such as an agent or a particle in metaheursitics , can move for a fixed number of iterations .    from the above equation \n , it can be expected that the new solution @xmath52 generated will be too far away from the old solution ( or more often the current best ) if @xmath30 is too large . \n then , a move that is too far away is unlikely to be accepted as a better solution . on the other hand , \n if @xmath30 is too small , the change is too small to be significant , and the new solution may be too close to the existing solution . consequently , the diversity of the new solutions is limited , and thus the search process is not efficient . therefore , an appropriate step size is important to maintain the search process as efficient as possible . \n there are extensive good theoretical results about isotropic random walks in the literature @xcite , and one of the results concerns the average distance @xmath53 traveled in the @xmath27-dimension space , which is r^2=2 d d t. here , @xmath54 is the effective diffusion coefficient where @xmath30 is the step size or distance traveled at each jump . in addition , @xmath31 is the time taken for each jump . by re - arranging the above equation , we get s^2= , which can be used to estimate the typical step sizes for a give problem . \n for example , for a typical scale @xmath10 of dimensions of interest , the local search is typically limited in a region of @xmath55 . as the iterations are discrete \n , @xmath56 can used for simplicity . \n obviously , the number of iterations should not be too large ; otherwise , the computational costs are too high . typically , the number of generations is usually @xmath57 to @xmath58 for most applications . \n therefore , we have s = . \n [ stepsize - equ-555 ]    let us try to do some estimates . \n for @xmath59 and @xmath57 , we have @xmath60 , while @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in addition , for @xmath64 and @xmath63 , we have @xmath65 . as \n step sizes could differ from variable to variable , a step size ratio @xmath66 is more generic . \n therefore , we can use @xmath67 to @xmath68 for most applications . in the rest of the paper \n , we will usually set the number of iterations as 200 in the case studies in section 5 . \n if an algorithm works well , the final accuracy of the obtained solution will depend on the number of iterations . in principle \n , a higher number of iterations may be more likely to obtain higher accuracy , though stagnation may occur . \n from the theory of random walks , we can estimate the number of iterations needed for a given tolerance , though such estimates are just guidelines . \n for example , in order to achieve the accuracy of @xmath69 , the number of steps or iterations @xmath70 needed by pure random walks can be estimated by n _ , which is essentially an upper bound . as an estimate for @xmath71 and @xmath64 , we have n _ 10 ^ 10 , [ nmax - old ] which is a huge number that is not easily achievable in practice . however , this number is still far smaller than that needed by a uniform or brute force search method . \n it is worth pointing out the above estimate is the upper limit for the worst - case scenarios . in reality , most metaheuristic algorithms require far fewer numbers of iterations .    though the above estimate may be crude , \n it does imply another interesting fact that the number of iterations will not be affected much by dimensionality . \n in fact , higher - dimensional problems do not necessarily increase the number of iterations . \n this may lead to a rather surprising possibility that random walks may be efficient in higher dimensions if the optimization problem is highly multimodal . \n this may provide some hints for designing better algorithms by cleverly using random walks and other randomization techniques . as we will see below \n , different random walks will indeed lead to different convergence rates , and lvy flights are one of the best randomization techniques .      as mentioned earlier , the variance of a gaussian random walk increases linearly with time @xmath5 , while the variance of lvy flights usually increases nonlinearly at a higher rate . as a result , if lvy flights instead of gaussian random walks are used , the above estimate becomes n _ ( ) ^1/(3- ) . \n [ levy - step ] if we use @xmath72 together the same values of @xmath71 , @xmath64 and @xmath69 , we have n _ 4.6 10 ^ 6 . [ nmax - mid ] it can be clearly seen that lvy flights can reduce the number of iterations by about 4 orders [ @xmath73 from @xmath74 in eq . \n ( [ nmax - old ] ) to @xmath75 in eq . \n ( [ nmax - mid ] ) . \n ideally , the step sizes in any nature - inspired algorithm should be controlled in such a way that they can do both local and global search more efficiently . to illustrate this point , \n let us split the search process into two stages as those in the efficient eagle strategy ( es ) , developed by xin - she yang and suash deb @xcite . \n the first stage uses a crude / large step , say , @xmath76 , and then in the second stage , a finer step size @xmath77 is used so as to achieve the same final accuracy as discussed in the previous section . \n the first stage can cover the whole region @xmath78 , while the second region should cover smaller , local regions of size @xmath79 . \n typically , @xmath80 . using the above values and @xmath81 and @xmath82 , then we have n_1 , 10 ^ 4 , n_2 , 10 ^ 4 . \n [ nmax - new ] it can be seen clearly that the number of iterations can be reduced by about 6 orders ( @xmath83 ) from @xmath74 [ see eq . \n ( [ nmax - old ] ) ] to @xmath84 [ see eq . \n ( [ nmax - new ] ) ] . \n this approximate values for the number of iterations have been observed and used in the literature @xcite . \n for example , the typical number of iterations for bat algorithm in @xcite and multiobjective cuckoo search in @xcite are typically 20,000 , which were indeed consistent with our estimations here . \n it is worth pointing out that the above reduction is by the two - stage eagle strategy only without using lvy flights . \n it can be expected that lvy flights can reduce the number of iterations even further . \n in fact , if lvy flights are used within the eagle strategy , then the above estimates can be reduced to n_1 , n_2 , 464 , which is obtained by substituting @xmath85 ( or @xmath79 ) and @xmath86 ( or @xmath87 ) into eq . \n ( [ levy - step ] ) . \n the relative lower number of iterations can be both practical and realistic . \n therefore , the good combination of lvy flights with eagle strategy can reduce the number of iterations from @xmath74 to less than @xmath88 , which works almost like a magic . \n this shows that , with a combination of good algorithms , eagle strategy can significantly reduce the computational efforts and may thus increase the search efficiency dramatically \n . it may be possible that a multi - stage eagle strategy can be developed to enhance this efficiency even further . \n the above analyses and observations have indicated that a proper combination of randomization techniques such as lvy flights , eagle strategy and a good optimizer such as apso can reduce the computational efforts dramatically and thus improve the search efficiently significantly . \n henceforth , we will use eagle strategy with apso to solve four nonlinear benchmarks so as to validate the above theoretical results . \n the four optimization benchmarks are : design optimization of a pressure vessel , a speed reducer , a pid controller and a heat exchanger . \n the parameter settings for the algorithms used in the rest of paper have been based on a parametric study . for the eagle strategy \n , we used 5 rounds of two - stage iterations , and each round used the apso for an intensive search . \n the population size is @xmath89 , and the iteration for apso was set to @xmath90 . \n this leads to a total of @xmath91 function evaluations for each case study . \n in addition , the parameters in apso have been set to be @xmath92 , and @xmath18 . \n pressure vessels are literally everywhere such as champagne bottles and gas tanks . for a given volume and working pressure , \n the basic aim of designing a cylindrical vessel is to minimize the total cost . typically , the design variables are the thickness @xmath93 of the head , the thickness @xmath94 of the body , the inner radius @xmath53 , and the length @xmath10 of the cylindrical section @xcite . \n this is a well - known test problem for optimization and it can be written as f ( ) = 0.6224 d_1 r l + 1.7781 d_2 r^2 + 3.1661 \n d_1 ^ 2 l + 19.84 d_1 ^ 2 r , subject to the following constraints :    lll g_1 ( ) = -d_1 + 0.0193 r 0 + g_2 ( ) = -d_2 + 0.00954 r 0 + g_3 ( ) = - r^2 l - r^3 + 1296000 0 + g_4 ( ) = l -240 0 . \n the simple bounds are 0.0625 d_1 , d_2 99 0.0625 , and 10.0 r , l 200.0 . \n recently , cagnina et al @xcite used an efficient particle swarm optimiser to solve this problem and they found the best solution @xmath95 at _ * ( 0.8125 , 0.4375 , 42.0984 , 176.6366 ) . \n this means the lowest price is about @xmath96 .    using es with apso \n , we obtained the same results , but we used significantly fewer function evaluations , comparing with apso alone and other methods . \n in fact , we use @xmath97 stages and each stage with a total of @xmath98 iterations . \n this is at least 10 times less than the iterations needed by standard pso . \n this again confirmed that es is indeed very efficient \n .      another important benchmark is the design of a speed reducer which is commonly used in many mechanisms such as a gearbox @xcite . \n this problem involves the optimization of 7 variables , including the face width , the number of teeth , the diameter of the shaft and others . \n all variables are continuous within some limits , except @xmath99 which only takes integer values . \n @xmath100 -1.508 x_1 ( x_6 ^ 2+x_7 ^ 2)+7.4777 ( x_6 ^ 3+x_7 ^ 3 ) + 0.7854 ( x_4 x_6 ^ 2+x_5 x_7 ^ 2 )    g_1 ( ) = -1 0 , g_2 ( ) = -1 0 ,    g_3()= - 1 0 , g_4()= - 1 0 ,    g_5 ( ) = -1 0 ,    g_6 ( ) = -1 0 , g_7 ( ) = -1 0 , g_8 ( ) = -1 0 , g_9()= -1 0 , g_10 ( ) = -1 0 , g_11 ( ) = -1 0 , where the simple bounds are @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 . in one of latest studies , \n cagnina et al . \n @xcite obtained the following solution _ * = ( 3.5 , 0.7 , 17 , 7.3 , 7.8 , 3.350214,5.286683 ) with @xmath108    using our es with apso , we have obtained the new best solution _ * = ( 3.5 , 0.7 , 17 , 7.3 , 7.8 , 3.34336449,5.285351 ) with the best objective @xmath109 . in existing studies \n @xcite , the total number of function evaluations was often 350,000 . here , we used @xmath89 for @xmath98 iterations and 5 rounds of eagle strategy runs , giving a total of @xmath110 function evaluations . \n this saves about 93% of the computational costs . \n we can see that es not only provides better solutions but also finds solutions more efficiently using fewer function evaluations . again \n the number of iterations ( 20,000 ) is consistent with our theoretical estimations given earlier in section 4 . \n let us use es with apso @xcite to design a well - known pid controller @xcite u(t)=k_p , where @xmath111 is the error signal between the response @xmath112 and the reference input @xmath113 , and @xmath114 is the input signal to the so - called plant model . \n the well - established ziegler - nichols tuning scheme can usually produce very good results . here \n , we use es with apso to minimize the rise time , the overshoot and settling time .    it is required to tune a third - order system with the following transfer function g(s ) = , so that responses of the closed loop system to track a reference meet the following requirements : rise time is less than 1.5 s , settling time is less than 5.5 s , and the overshoot is less than 5% . \n if we use the standard matlab control system toolbox @xcite , the obtained design by the ziegler - nichols scheme is g_pid(s)=0.311 ( 1 + + 0.5911 s ) , which gives a rise time of 1.6 s , a settling time of 4.95 , and overshoot of about 8.54% . \n clearly , not all two requirements are met .    in order to refine the designs , we use es with apso , and the results \n are shown in fig . \n [ fig-100 ] . \n the final design becomes g_pid , new(s)=0.5366 ( 1 + + 0.8485 s ) , which gives a rise time of 1.0 s , a settling time of 5.25 s , and the overshoot of 4.97% . \n all the design requirements are met by this new design . \n as before , the total number of function evaluations is 20,000 .    , width=288,height=192 ]      heat transfer management is very important in many applications such as central heating systems and microelectronics . \n there are many well - known benchmarks for testing design / optimization tools , and one of the benchmarks is the design of a heat exchanger @xcite . \n this design problem has 8 design variables and 6 inequality constraints , which can be written as f ( ) = x_1 + x_2 + x_3 , subject to g_1()=0.0025(x_4+x_6)-1 0 , g_2()=0.0025(x_5+x_7-x_4 ) -1 0 , g_3()=0.01(x_8-x_5 ) -1 0 , g_4()=833.33252 x_4 + 100 x_1 -x_1 x_6 - 83333.333 0 , g_5()=1250 x_5 + x_2 ( x_4 - x_7 ) -120 x_4 0 , g_6()=x_3 x_5 -2500 x_5 - x_3 x_8 + 1.25 10 ^ 6 0 . \n the first three constraints are linear , while the last three constraints are nonlinear .    by using es with apso for the same parameter values of @xmath89 , @xmath90 iterations and @xmath97 es stages \n , we obtained the best solution @xmath115 295.60118 , 217.98230 , 286.41653 , 395.60118 ) , which gives the optimal objective of @xmath116 . \n this is exactly the same as the best solution found by yang and gandomi @xcite and is better than the best solutions reported in the previous literature @xcite . in the study by jaberipour and khorram , \n they used 200,000 function evaluations , while deb used 320,080 function evaluations@xcite . in the present study , we have used 20,000 function evaluations that is less than 10% of the computational costs by other researchers .    as we can see from the above 4 case studies , es with apso can save about 90% of the computational costs , which demonstrates the superior performance of es with apso . in order to show that the improvements are significant \n , we use the standard student @xmath5-test in terms of the numbers of functional evaluations . for @xmath117 , \n the two - sample @xmath5-test gives @xmath118 , which means that the improvements are statistically significant . \n all swarm - intelligence - based algorithms such as pso and firefly algorithm can be viewed in a unified framework of markov chains ; however , theoretical analysis remains challenging . \n we have used the fundamental concepts of random walks and lvy flights to analyze the efficiency of random walks in nature - inspired metaheuristic algorithms . \n we have demonstrated that lvy flights can be significantly more efficient than standard gaussian random walks under appropriate conditions . by the right combination with eagle strategy , \n significant computational efforts can be saved , as we have shown in the paper . \n the theory of interacting markov chains is complicated and yet still under active development ; however , any progress in such areas will play a central role in understanding how population- and trajectory - based metaheuristic algorithms perform under various conditions . \n even though we do not fully understand why metaheuristic algorithms work , this does not hinder us to use these algorithms efficiently . \n on the contrary , such mysteries can drive and motivate us to pursue further research and development in metaheuristics . \n further research can focus on the extensive testing of metaheuristics over a wide range of large -

The results show a amplified Doppler shift in the diffraction images as a function of the laser beam alignment relative to the Earth's velocity vector, which is well described by the Ether Gauge Theory. This theory extends Lorentz's Ether Theory by introducing a gauge of the length and time, which leads to a non-isotropic light propagation relative to the Earth frame and a preferred direction. The results agree with previous analyses that suggest the presence of a preferred frame and the breakdown of the symmetry-energy and symmetry-momentum conservation laws. The implications of these findings are significant, as they challenge a fundamental principle of Special Relativity and suggest the existence of an absolute space-time.", "gpt35": "The article discusses the special relativity theory (SRT) and its introduction of the universal fundamental constant, the speed of light in space. The SRT states that all reference frames are equivalent and that an ether rest frame is unnecessary. Various experiments have been conducted to test the predictions of SRT, including round-trip and one-way light path tests of light speed isotropy. These experiments have only found upper limits and are in agreement with the predictions of SRT. However, recent evidence suggests that the propagation of light over cosmological distances may have anisotropic characteristics, indicating the existence of a preferred reference frame. This aligns with interpretations of the COBE measurements, which give the Earth's \"absolute\" velocity in relation to the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR). The article also discusses the concept of absolute space-time and its implications for conservation laws and symmetry. The main objective of the article is to present experimental results on an \"one-way light path\" laser diffraction experiment that shows the dependency of the speed of light on propagation direction. These results are well described by the ether gauge theory (EGT), an extension of Lorentz's ether theory. The EGT scenario satisfies the cosmological time boundary condition and leads to non-isotropic light propagation relative to the Earth frame with a preferred direction.

time diagram ( light cone ) in the @xmath4 frame . \n it is possible to see that the axis - x ( direction of @xmath21 ) behaves as a preferred direction . \n the cone of light is symmetric in relation to the y - axis , while it is asymmetric in relation to the x - axis . \n the slope of the lines is proportional to the inverse value of the speed of light . for illustrative purpose \n , a large value for @xmath22 in this diagram has been used . \n the effect , for instance , due to the earth motion relative to the cmbr rest frame is tiny ( @xmath23 ) . from this picture , it is possible to see that there is a resulting vector speed of light , and it is represented as @xmath24 in fig.1 , and hereafter it will be called as the emission vector . \n the emission vector points in opposite direction of the vector @xmath25 and , following eq.(4 ) , the emission vector has a module given by @xmath26 with amounts to @xmath27 . \n the effect due to the earth motion gives @xmath28 . \n on the other hand , the one -

way speed of light `` dipole '' anisotropy is defined as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the average values as @xmath32 with eq.(6 ) and eq.(7 ) , eq.(8 ) becomes @xmath33 thus the egt scenario predicts a `` dipole '' speed of light anisotropy with an amplitude @xmath34 , which coincides with the value of the dipole temperature anisotropy ( @xmath35 ) of the cmbr as observed by cobe . \n fig.2 summarized the situation , where the dependence of the `` dipole '' speed of light anisotropy is plotted as function of @xmath20 . \n following fig.2 , it is possible to see that in earth - based experiments , the choice of the direction of the light beam is essential , an random choice for the light beam direction , as in experiment mounted on a rotating table , can easily lead to ambiguous results . in order to compensate the change of direction due to the earth rotation \n , the earth - based experiments must be mounted like a optical telescope using an equatorial ensemble , for intance . \n the tupi muon telescope is installed on the campus of the universidade federal fluminense , niteri , rio de janeiro - brazil at sea level . \n the position is : latitude : @xmath36 s , longitude : @xmath37 w. the tupi muon telescope has an equatorial assembly and a servo - mechanism which allows the axis of the telescope to be pointed so as to accompany a given source @xcite .    on the other hand , the bigger temperature anisotropy in the cosmic background radiation \n is represented by a dipole with an amplitude of @xmath38 which arises from the motion of the solar system barycenter with a velocity @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) at 68%cl , relative to the so called `` cmbr rest frame '' and towards a point whose equatorial coordinates are @xmath41)@xcite . \n this direction points for the crater constellation . \n a laser light diffraction experiment has been mounted in the shell of the tupi muon telescope , as is represented in fig.3 . \n the layout of the diffraction device is shows in fig.4 , the experiment permits us to obtain the variations of the diffraction line positions , @xmath42 , as a function of the laser beam alignment , @xmath20 , relative to the earth s velocity vector , obtained by cobe . \n this experiment is an improved version of an experiment accomplished in 1980 in campinas brazil and suggested by c. m. g. lattes ( with unpublished results ) . just as in the modern version of the michelson - morley experiment \n @xcite , where anisotropies are sought in the light ( radiation ) propagation due the earth rotation , the lattes version tried to measure variations of the positions ( @xmath42)(see fig.4 ) of the diffraction lines due to the earth s rotation . \n this requires to make measurements over long time of at least several days to weeks , and it is necessary to take into account the atmospheric pressure and temperature variations among others , because the daily atmospheric variations may mask the effect .    in the tupi laser diffraction experiment , a complete set of measurements is made in only ten minutes . \n in addition , just as it is shown below , the @xmath42 variations are bigger when the direction of the laser beam goes from parallel to anti - parallel to the earth s velocity vector ( ether drift ) . \n fig.4 shows a schematic diagram of the tupi laser diffraction experiment in the earth ( @xmath4 frame ) . following this figure , it is possible to see that the maxima of intensity of the diffraction images satisfy the condition @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the wave length in the @xmath4 frame and @xmath45 is the diffraction grating step . under the conditions \n @xmath46 we have @xmath47 the wave length @xmath44 can be obtained as the ratio between the speed of light @xmath48 and the light frequency @xmath49 resulting into @xmath50 . \n an expression for the @xmath44 as a function of the angle @xmath20 can be obtained using the transformation equations from @xmath4 to @xmath3 supplied by the egt formalism , which for @xmath48 gives @xmath51 on the other hand , according to the egt formalism ( see section 2 ) , the space - time diagram or light cone in the @xmath4 frame is asymmetric in relation to the axis parallel to the earth s speed vector , @xmath25 , and there is the emission s vector ( see fig.1 ) represented as @xmath24 in fig.4 , where p represent the point of emission of light in the laser . \n this vector points in opposite direction of the earth s motion and its module is @xmath52 . \n this is equivalent to consider a source moving away at speed @xmath53 . while in the @xmath3 frame we have a source moving away at speed @xmath54 . \n consequently , a relation for the doppler effect must be used to obtain @xmath49 . \n the relation for the doppler effect obtained on the basis of the egt formalism is the same as the relation obtained by using the srt one since they are in agreement with experimental measurement @xcite . \n this suggest that locally , both the srt and the egt theories are indistinguishable , although they differ when global aspects are considered . \n the relation of the doppler effect is @xmath55    including the last two expressions in @xmath44 result in @xmath56 where @xmath57 . \n thus the combined effect , the @xmath58 and the apparent source motion @xmath59 results in a `` amplified '' doppler shift of the diffraction images . \n expanding in terms of @xmath5 we have @xmath60\\lambda_0.\\ ] ] considering only the first order terms in @xmath5 , @xmath42 reads @xmath61.\\ ] ] now , if we denominate @xmath62 , the relative variation of @xmath42 can be found as @xmath63 thus the egt scenario for the relative variation ( shift ) @xmath64 of a diffraction image predicts an amplitude twice bigger than the dipole speed of light anisotropy and differs from the srt prediction where @xmath65 . \n we have compared these two predictions with experimental data obtained from measurements on light diffraction produced by a laser beam in perpendicular incidence on a diffraction grating as a function of the laser beam alignment relative to the earth s velocity vector . \n so far , we have three complete sets of independent observations made in three days , february 20 and 21 and march 9 of 2006 . in order to avoid contaminations on the diffraction observations due to atmospheric fluctuations such as pressure and temperature among others , each set of observations \n were obtained in ten minutes by photographing the diffraction image in 19 different positions of the angle @xmath20 , from @xmath66 up to @xmath67 in steps of @xmath68 . \n a digital machine of 3.2 mega pixels , fixed in the telescope has been used . \n an off - line analysis of the digital images has been done , by using a special software . \n the method permits us to count the number of pixels between two points of the image . \n our goal is to obtain only the relative variations in the position of the diffraction images , and it is not necessary to do calibrations . \n we present here the measurements made on march 9 , 2006 where a diffraction grating of @xmath69 and a helio - neon laser of @xmath70 and @xmath71 has been used . \n each position @xmath42 has been measured with an accuracy of @xmath72 . \n fig.5 shows the amplified doppler shift observed through the overlap of diffraction images as a function of the laser beam alignment relative to the earth s velocity vector the images were filtered and amplified using always the same criteria . \n the colors in the images are artificial and the vertical lines were placed only as a visual guide . \n a quantitative result , showing the relative amplified doppler shift as function of the laser beam alignment , is summarized in fig.6 , where the srt and egt predictions are compares with the experimental data . \n an experimental and theoretical survey has been made on the one - way light propagation on earth . \n the measurements have been obtained by using the tupi diffraction laser experiment , and they have been analyzed on the basis of the egt formalism . \n we find that there is evidences for an anisotropic light propagation ( a first - order ether drift effect ) , because an amplified doppler shift has been observed through the overlap of diffraction images as a function of the laser beam alignment relative to the earth s velocity vector . \n this behavior arises of the earth s motion ( solar barycenter ) relative to the cmbr rest frame . \n these experimental results contradict the so called lorentz s theorem @xcite , which states that the course of the relative rays is not affected by the motion of the earth if quantities of the second order are neglected . now , after our experimental results , that certainly will be confirmed by other similar experiments , we conclude that the course of the rays is affected by the motion of the earth , and a predominant quantity of first order describes well the experimental results . \n of course , the observation of this effect requires a careful determination of the `` ether drift direction '' , and only in 1991 after the publication of the cobe s results , that we know this direction with accuracy . \n our results point out that is not possible to neglect the preferred frame imposed by the cosmology . \n these results are well described by the ether gauge theory ( egt ) and which incorporates the cosmological time constraint . however \n , when only local aspects are considered the egt predictions agree with the srt predictions , they are basically indistinguishable locally . \n finally , we are conscious that only after an independent confirmation of our experimental data that they will have a total credibility and we hope that this happens soon , because the experiment is easy to reproduce . until then \n , we have the conviction that the universe behaves as a birefringent crystal ball . \n this paper is a memorial tribute to our professor and friend c.m.g . \n lattes , he was who introduced us the non -

resolution x - ray image of the lobe of ctb  109  obtained with _ chandra _ \n the image is binned with a size of 4 pixels ( 1 pixel = 0.492 ) and smoothed with a gaussian with a sigma of 2 pixels ( the original pixels binned by 4 ) . \n x - ray spectra which are extracted at regions corresponding to co clouds are also discussed , in order to obtain the absorbing foreground hydrogen column density ( ) . the spectra are binned with a minimum of 50 counts per bin and analyzed using the x - ray spectral analysis tool xspec . to fit the spectra \n , we use a model for a thermal plasma in non - equilibrium ionization with variable abundances ( vnei ) and hydrogen column density , , for the foreground absorption ( phabs ) . \n in figure [ chandraco ] we display the distribution of molecular gas in the vicinity of the x - ray lobe . in the left image , \n the co arm discovered by is shown . \n the anti - correlation of the co emission with the _ chandra _  image nicely demonstrates that this molecular cloud is located in the foreground and absorbs the x - ray emission from ctb  109  coming from behind it . in the right panel we averaged the co emission over a velocity range more negative than that of the co arm . \n we can identify three small molecular clouds surrounding the eastern part of ctb  109 s x - ray lobe with the brightest to the galactic east ( on the left side of the lobe in fig.[chandraco ] , hereafter east ) , a fainter one to the galactic north ( above the lobe , hereafter north ) , and another one in the galactic south ( below the lobe , hereafter south ) which is not fully covered by our observations . the noise level in the image \n is @xmath12.03em40  mk . assuming the progenitor star exploded at or close to the current position of the anomalous x - ray pulsar 1e2259 + 586 , the location of these clouds is suggestive of an interaction of the snr shock wave with those molecular clouds resulting in the x - ray lobe . \n most of the molecular clouds are rather faint in the @xmath5co line , which is why we can not perform a detailed comparison with the @xmath1co measurements . \n however , we can estimate an average brightness ratio for each of the clouds ( see table [ cotab ] ) . \n the value for the southern cloud is a bit difficult to interpret since it is not fully covered by our observations and it seems to consist of a number of small clouds . \n we find brightness ratios between 3.5 in the dense part of the co arm and 13 in the southern clouds . according to @xcite , at the galactocentric radius of ctb  109 \n the @xmath1c to @xmath5c isotope ratio @xmath13 should be about 63 . \n this indicates that we miss some of the @xmath1co emission and this line is optically thick .    in the following we assume local thermodynamic equilibrium and the same excitation temperature for both isotopic species and all molecules along the line of sight in each cloud . \n we determine an average optical depth for each cloud in both lines by the following procedure : we use the @xmath1co to @xmath5co ratio for each cloud to determine how much @xmath1co emission we are missing by assuming the @xmath5co line is optically thin . \n this can be translated to a first iteration for the optical depth @xmath14 . \n if both species have the same excitation temperature the @xmath1co to @xmath5co brightness temperature ratio @xmath13 can be written as : @xmath15 . from this \n we determine a first iteration for the optical depth @xmath16 of the @xmath5co line . \n this is again used to determine a better value for the missing @xmath1co emission and so on . \n this iterative procedure converges usually after just a few iterations . \n the results for @xmath14 and @xmath16 are listed in table [ cotab ] . to integrate the @xmath5co column density we actually use the @xmath1co data scaled to @xmath5co by the brightness ratios for each individual cloud since the signal to noise ratio is higher in our @xmath1co data . the @xmath5co column density \n is then scaled by @xmath17 to determine the column density of the h@xmath18  molecules  @xcite . \n we also estimate h@xmath19 number densities and masses of the clouds ( table [ cotab ] ) . while the northern cloud , the southern cloud , and the faint eastern tail of the eastern cloud have comparable h@xmath18  column densities ( @xmath20  @xmath3 ) , the bright part of the eastern cloud that overlaps the lobe has a higher  @xmath2  @xmath3 . \n it is interesting to note that we calculated a peak h@xmath19 column density of @xmath21  @xmath3 for the co arm , which compares nicely with the value of @xmath22  @xmath3 determined by .    in order to compare with these results , \n we extract spectra from the _ chandra _   data in regions corresponding to the co clouds and derive the atomic h column density  in the foreground by fitting the spectrum with a model including a thermal non - equilibrium ionization model and a foreground absorption . for the northern cloud , \n we obtain = 6.3 ( 5.6  7.0 ) @xmath23  @xmath3 ( 90% confidence range in parentheses ) . for the larger eastern cloud , the foreground absorption of the part inside the lobe is  = 4.5 ( 4.2  4.9 ) @xmath23  @xmath3 , outside the lobe \n , we get  = 5.9 ( 5.5  6.4 ) @xmath23  @xmath3 , and in the eastern tail the foreground absorption is  = 5.0 ( 4.2  5.4 ) @xmath23  @xmath3 . although the  column density is largest in the bright part of the eastern cloud , the foreground  is the lowest . \n therefore , the eastern cloud is not located in front of the lobe . \n the foreground absorption in the region of the southern cloud is  = 6.8 ( 5.8  7.3 ) @xmath23  @xmath3 . \n the x - ray absorption is significantly higher in the regions corresponding to the northern cloud and the southern cloud than in the eastern tail of the eastern cloud . \n it seems that these two clouds are located in front of the remnant and absorb some of the x - ray emission . \n as the snr is believed to be located next to the gmc , we assume that both have a systematic velocity of @xmath24 . \n the three clouds ( radial velocities between @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) are slightly blue - shifted from the gmc to the west , indicating that these clouds are moving towards us relative to the gmc complex . \n as the bright eastern cloud seems to be related to the x - ray lobe , we study the velocity profiles of the @xmath1co emission in different parts of the eastern cloud . \n this cloud contains the infrared ( ir ) source iras23004 + 5841 , which has ir colors of a star forming region according to . \n figure [ covelocities ] compares the profiles taken at the center of iras23004 + 5841 ( position a ) and in the interior of the lobe ( position b , as marked in the right panel in fig.[chandraco ] ) . \n while the first appears gaussian , the latter has an additional component towards higher negative velocities . \n the asymmetry observed in the spectrum suggests that the material has been accelerated by the shock wave of the snr which traveled into the cloud . \n the co line profile is only broadened by a few km  s@xmath27 which indicates that the acceleration is mostly perpendicular to the line of sight . \n the estimated mass of the part of the cloud with the high velocity wing is 3  4  @xmath28 . \n we have also taken profiles from parts of the east cloud that do not overlap with the lobe . \n the velocity profiles of the northern end of the east cloud and the faint tail in the east show that there is a velocity gradient . \n the center of the profile changes from @xmath29 to @xmath30 with increasing distance to the lobe , i.e.  the eastern part of the cloud is red - shifted relative to the western part . \n this gradient indicates an acceleration of the gas in the faint tail away from the eastern cloud . \n as the gradient starts at the position of iras23004 + 5841 , it might be an outflow from the star forming region . \n the column densities of h@xmath18  and the x - ray absorbing hydrogen indicate that the northern cloud and the southern cloud are located in front of the x - ray emission \n . the eastern cloud , however , seems to be linked to the lobe . \n moreover , the co velocity profile shows an additional blue - shifted component in the eastern cloud where it overlaps the lobe , suggesting that the cloud has been hit by a shock . \n the eastern tail of the eastern cloud does nt show such an additional velocity component and seems to be red - shifted relative to the interacting part of the cloud . \n figure [ skizze ] illustrates how the bright eastern co cloud and the lobe are possibly located within the remnant . as in such a configuration \n , the cloud would have a significant velocity component towards us at position b whereas the acceleration is directed perpendicular to the line of sight at position a , a high velocity wing in the velocity profile of the cloud is only observed at position b.    as we believe that the x - ray lobe was formed by evaporation of a cloud , we estimate the cloud mass from the x - ray emission . \n we assume that the emission is coming only from the lobe and that the evaporated cloud now fills a sphere with a radius of 3 . \n the xspec model vnei that we use for the spectral fits , gives the normalization @xmath31 \\times \\int n_e n_h dv$ ] . \n the mean @xmath32 per arcsec@xmath33 in the lobe is 2.0@xmath34  @xmath35  arcsec@xmath36 . for a distance @xmath37 \n = 3  kpc @xcite and @xmath38 = 1.2 @xmath39 , we get @xmath39 = 0.9  @xmath40 and a mass of @xmath41 for the x - ray gas of the lobe . \n the mass of the observed co clouds are higher than the estimated mass of the evaporated cloud \n . this could be the reason why the clouds still exist . \n we performed observations of @xmath1co and @xmath5co as well as a _ \n chandra _   observation of the region around the x - ray lobe of ctb  109 . \n we have discovered three co clouds around the lobe . \n all three clouds are blue - shifted relative to the gmc in the west of ctb  109 . \n the foreground   indicates that two clouds in the north and in the south of the lobe are located in front of the bright x - ray lobe , whereas the east cloud might be connected to the lobe . \n therefore , the east co cloud and the x - ray lobe seem to be evidence for an interaction between the snr shock wave and a dense cloud . \n the velocity profiles of the @xmath1co emission in the east cloud show that there is a velocity gradient in the faint tail in the east , indicating that the eastern part of the cloud is red - shifted . \n the bright western part of the cloud overlaps with the x - ray lobe . \n the @xmath1co velocity profile at this position has an negative velocity wing indicating an additional acceleration in this part of the cloud . at this position \n where the co and the bright x - ray emission overlap , there is also an extended ir source ( iras23004 + 5841 ) which might be emission from a star forming region . from the new co and x - ray data \n we conclude that we have found strong evidence for a shock - cloud interaction at the north - east end of the x - ray lobe . \n support for this work was provided by the national aeronautics and space administration through _ chandra _  award number g04 - 5068x issued by the _ chandra _  x -

However, CSP faces three key challenges: computational cost, accuracy, and kinetic factors. Recent advances in hardware performance and efficient algorithms have made it possible to explore a wider region of the phase space, and the transition from empirical interatomic potentials to quantum mechanical techniques, such as density functional theory (DFT), has improved predictive power. Nevertheless, DFT functionals fail to accurately describe van der Waals (vdW) interactions, which are crucial for predicting polymorphism. Recent breakthroughs in non-local functionals that accurately describe vdW interactions have been proposed, and they have shown promising results in various systems.\n\nIn this study, we combine the progress in DFT with evolutionary CSP, specifically adapted for molecular structure search, to perform a fully ab initio CSP search on glycine crystals. We assess whether state-of-the-art ab initio CSP can pass the challenging blind test of exploring the phase space of polymorphic glycine.

The use of density functional theory (DFT) has also improved predictive power, although standard DFT functionals do not accurately describe van der Waals interactions, leading to the use of approximate corrections. Recently, non-local functionals that accurately describe dispersion interactions have been proposed, showing success in various systems. In this study, the researchers combine these advancements in DFT with evolutionary crystal structure prediction methods to perform a fully ab initio search for polymorphic glycine crystals. Glycine, the smallest amino acid, exhibits rich polymorphism under ambient conditions that become less understood at higher pressures. The study aims to determine if state-of-the-art ab-initio crystal structure prediction can accurately explore the phase space of glycine polymorphism.", "human": "accurate molecular crystal structure prediction is a fundamental goal in academic and industrial condensed matter research and polymorphism is arguably the biggest obstacle on the way . \n we tackle this challenge in the difficult case of the repeatedly studied , abundantly used aminoacid glycine that hosts still little -

low energies among polymorphs @xcite , and * iii ) * the fact that kinetic factors may control the crystallization procedure rather than thermodynamic ones @xcite . \n the past decade witnessed these challenges being tackled by the scientific community and the progress can be followed through the blind tests organized yearly by the cambridge crystallographic data centre @xcite . \n the exponential growth in the hardware performance and new , efficient algorithms tailored for molecular crystals have allowed a wider region of the phase space to be explored . \n the increased computational performance also enabled a transition from empirical interatomic potentials to more accurate but time consuming quantum mechanical techniques , mainly density functional theory ( dft ) . \n this transition did not guarantee however an increase in predictive power in all cases @xcite : the standard dft functionals do not describe properly van der waals ( vdw ) interactions , which forces csp studies to employ approximate semi - empirical corrections . \n these approximations to vdw interactions strongly affect the energy ordering of explored structures , which is a core information in predicting polymorphism . hence , to render csp predictions reliable , a fully ab initio method , able to obtain an accurate lattice energy including the vdw interactions , has been highly desirable . \n recently a breakthrough in the description of vdw interactions in dft has been made : many new non - local functionals that accurately describe the dispersion interactions have been proposed and demonstrated unprecedented success in a wide range of systems from molecules , molecular crystals to layered materials , with a computational cost comparable to that of standard functionals @xcite . \n it has been recently shown that even in difficult cases such as glycine crystals , where polymorphs show energy differences as little as 1 kcal / mol , new non - local functionals can yield the correct stability ordering as well as accurate pressure evolution @xcite .    encouraged by these results we combine this critical progress in dft with recent developments in evolutionary csp @xcite , specifically adapted for molecular structure search @xcite , and perform a fully ab initio csp search on glycine crystals , without semi empirical corrections in the energy description , using neither information on cell geometry nor the symmetry of the experimentally observed polymorphs . \n we thus assess whether state - of - the - art ab - initio csp can pass the challenging blind test of exploring the phase space of polymorphic glycine . \n glycine , nh@xmath2ch@xmath2cooh , the smallest aminoacid , is an excellent test case for csp studies as its already rich polymorphism under ambient conditions is amplified and becomes less understood at higher pressure ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .    , with indicated @xmath3 molecules in unit cell , \n the form readily obtained by evaporation of aqueous solutions is @xmath1-glycine , which for long was believed to be the most stable phase instead of the later discovered ground - state phase @xmath4 . \n pressure evolution of ambient pressure phases show that while @xmath4 and @xmath5 phases quickly lose single crystal nature or undergo a phase transition within a few gpa , @xmath1 phase stays stable up to 23  gpa , the highest pressure reached in experiments . \n a reversible , hysteresis - free single - crystal to single - crystal transition occurs from @xmath5 to @xmath6 phase at 0.76  gpa . \n single crystals of the @xmath4 phase instead undergo an extended polymorphic transformation in the wide range of 2.7 - 7.6  gpa , to a high - pressure polymorph , the @xmath7 phase , accompanied with the fragmentation of single crystals into powder . upon decompression , the @xmath7 phase is stable down to 0.62  gpa , where a new , irreversible phase transition occurs to the @xmath0 phase , a new polymorph which is reported to be stable at ambient conditions for at least three days.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    a clear example to this is the @xmath0 phase , which is reported to be stable at ambient conditions for at least three days @xcite . \n interestingly , despite its stability , and at least three csp studies devoted to glycine so far @xcite , a decade after its observation , the @xmath0 phase has not been structurally resolved yet . \n the complex polymorphism of glycine highlights the importance of performing an extensive search in phase space , while practical concerns limit any csp study to explore primarily the lowest energy structures . in this study \n we use evolutionary algorithms ( ea ) as implemented in the uspex package to address this interplay efficiently @xcite . \n we perform three test suits with z=2 , 3 or 4 glycine molecules in the crystal unit cell . at the first generation , we start with a population of 30 random structures . \n this population evolves through generations where only the thermodynamically most stable members are allowed to procreate. the procreation operations are cross - overs of parent structures , and mutations that involve variation of the molecular position and orientation . \n the diversity of the population is guaranteed by addition of new random structures at each generation . \n the highest computational cost in this workflow is due to the ab initio geometry optimization of each structure considered . to keep this cost well within the capacity of modern high - performance computing technologies and within the budget of academic as well as industrial research , we limit the evolution to 20 generations at most ( see methods for details ) . \n we use ea as implemented in the uspex package to search for the low - energy structures of glycine with z=2 , 3 or 4 molecules in the unit cell . at the first generation , \n 30 structures are created randomly . \n after energy ordering , the @xmath8 of the population that is energetically least favorable is discarded . among the remaining , \n a fingerprint analysis is performed and potential parents whose fingerprint is within a threshold distance of 0.01 from any lower energy structure are discarded as well . \n the so - determined unique structures are eligible as parents and are allowed to procreate . \n the 30 new structures of the next generation are created from parents through the following operations : heredity ( cross - over of two structures ) ( @xmath9 ) , softmutation ( translation and rotation based on estimate of soft vibrational modes ) ( @xmath8 ) , rotation of the molecule ( @xmath8 ) , and random structure generation ( @xmath8 ) . \n in addition , the three best parents are directly cloned to the next generation . in all simulations , \n the maximum number of generations was 20 .      for every structure generated by uspex , \n the geometry and cell relaxation is performed using vdw - df functional @xcite which was implemented in the quantum espresso package @xcite . \n a kinetic energy cutoff of @xmath10 ryd and a charge density cutoff of @xmath11 ryd are used . \n the brillouin zone sampling resolution was gradually increased in three steps during relaxation : resolution of @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively . \n energies and geometries of the last step with the densest k - point are used throughout the study . \n paw pseudopotentials are taken from the pslibrary project@xcite . by using this setup all structures \n are fully relaxed within a convergence of less than 0.1 mry for absolute total energy , @xmath15 mry / a.u . for the forces on atoms and less than @xmath16 \n gpa for the stress tensor . \n the cluster analysis is performed by using single linkage clustering , where two structures with fingerprint distance less than distance threshold @xmath17 are considered to belong to the same cluster . since uspex definition of fingerprint \n does not include any information on the enthalpy of the structure , a constraint is added such that two structures with enthalpy difference more than 0.5 kj / mol are not allowed to form a cluster . \n this constraint is found necessary only when the clustering analysis is performed for all the encountered structures , while limiting the analysis to low enthalpy region , such constraint was not necessary as each cluster was successfully identified with distance only . \n the results of csp can be visualized through the distribution of energy as a function of volume for the structures encountered during the search . despite the exploration of a wide region in phase space \n ( see left panel of fig.[fig2 ] ) ,     phase . as shown in the _ inset _ of the z=4 panel , \n crowding around each polymorph , when compared with its equation of state , is compatible with numerical noise due to incomplete relaxation . \n the distance - based clustering techniques adopted here are however well suited to separate and identify the different low lying polymorphs even in presence of noise . \n , scaledwidth=47.0% ]    about 40% of all the structures lies within 4 kj / mol of the experimentally known ground state structure , @xmath4 . focusing on this region of the energy landscape as shown in the right panels of fig.[fig2 ] , \n we see structures forming islands with varying size and shapes . \n this feature illustrates the added complication in the case of molecular csp with respect to standard inorganic solids where a well - defined , isolated minimum would be observed for each phase . \n the shape and finite size of the islands can be understood considering that glycine is very soft , therefore structures that are far off from the equilibrium lattice parameters are thermodynamically penalized only slightly as demonstrated in the inset of fig.[fig2 ] . \n this effect , combined with the numerical noise in geometry optimization , as well as an increased number of degrees of freedom in molecular crystals , is enough to give rise to crowding around each polymorphic minimum . \n nevertheless islands are well separated and a clear assignment of polymorphs can be made for most of them . \n this is in stark contradiction with a very recent csp study for glycine with empirical corrections for intermolecular interactions , which reported that the obtained energy - volume points were not separated well enough to clearly identify each polymorph , thus underlining the challenge of polymorphism for csp @xcite . in this study instead \n the separation between several islands are well represented down to very small energy differences ( inset of fig.[fig2 ] ) . \n we believe this stems from the leap in accuracy and precision reached by the use of fully ab initio energetics together with last generation evolutionary algorithm tools . \n ssibility of machine learning the polymorphs reliable energetics from ab initio calculations is necessary but not sufficient to guarantee a reliable structure classification in csp . \n more than one polymorph can be present within a given extended island ; or what appears to be two adjacent islands due to insufficient sampling and/or relaxation , may actually correspond to the same packing order . indeed the most human - time consuming part of a csp procedure is known to be the stage where the output structures are comparatively examined in order to successfully separate the essential data from the crowd of repetitions @xcite . \n although not utilized to their full extent within csp , concepts from data mining , mainly clustering techniques , can be of great help in this stage of the analysis , as we demonstrate in the following . \n * for all structures ( green line ) and low - energy structures within approximately 4 kj / mol of the ground state ( blue line ) for the case of @xmath18 . \n insets show the enthalpy ( kj / mol ) as a function of volume ( @xmath19 ) per molecule for different values of @xmath20 . \n different colors and point types in each inset correspond to different clusters . \n the value of @xmath21 can distinguish different clusters successfully . \n for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , see supplementary material fig.s1,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    in fig.[fig3 ] we display a step by step clustering analysis where a bottom - up distance - based hierarchical clustering approach with single linkage is used to identify the unique polymorphs among all the structures obtained with csp . in distance - based approaches , a similarity metric \n is defined so that a distance can be measured between data points , and clusters are constructed based on proximity . in this study \n we use as the metric the fingerprint - based cosine distance @xcite defined in the ea code uspex @xcite : @xmath24 where individual structure fingerprints are defined as @xmath25 where the double sum runs over all @xmath26th molecules of type @xmath27 within the unit cell and all @xmath28th molecules of type @xmath29 within a distance @xmath30 ; @xmath31 is a gaussian - smeared delta function ; @xmath32 is the distance measured from the centers of molecules @xmath26 and @xmath28 ; @xmath33 is the unit cell volume ; the function @xmath34 is discretized over bins of width @xmath35 ; @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the number of molecules of type @xmath27 and @xmath29 , respectively .    the distance threshold used to define whether two data points belong to the same cluster is then monotonically increased . as a result \n the cluster population evolves from the situation where every data point forms a distinct cluster to the situation in which all data points belong to the same global cluster , revealing the bottom - up and hierarchical nature of the approach . \n translated to the csp problem , this data mining approach transforms the challenge of identification of unique polymorphs from the visual comparison of all structures into an easier decision on the value of the distance - threshold . \n the optimal distance threshold is such that each data cluster matches a unique physical polymorph . in the case of glycine a distance threshold around 0.05 - 0.1 \n is found to be appropriate to identify the low energy polymorphs successfully ( see supplementary material table.s1 and related .cif files ) . \n the so - determined optimal threshold can serve in advanced supervised learning techniques and be fed back in the csp procedure to increase considerably the efficiency by reducing the generation of replicas of already explored structures . \n the cluster analysis outlined above identifies all experimentally observed phases of glycine compatible with 2 , 3 or 4 molecules per cell , as well as suggesting others , hereon named according to their enthalpy - per - molecule ordering . \n phases 1 to 11 lie within approximately 2  kj / mol of the experimentally most stable phase , @xmath4 . among them \n one of the lowest energy polymorphs ( phase 2 ) can be identified with @xmath0glycine based on the excellent agreement with xrd results ( fig.[fig4](a ) ) as well as its pressure evolution ( fig.[fig4](b ) ) \n .     phase . * * a*. comparison of simulated x - ray diffraction patterns for @xmath7- , @xmath4- and @xmath0 - glycine at 2 gpa with experimental data taken from @xcite at 0.2 gpa . \n the xrd of proposed @xmath0-glycine can explain most of the unassigned peaks that were marked in the experimental spectrum . \n the theoretical spectra are calculated at higher pressure to offset the overestimation of ground state volumes in ab initio calculations . * b*. enthalpy per molecule as a function of pressure for @xmath7-glycine and @xmath0-glycine with respect to the @xmath4 phase up to 5 gpa . \n the black arrows indicate the phase transitions observed in the experiment @xcite : under pressure , the @xmath4 phase undergoes a phase transition to @xmath7-glycine . \n the decompression of @xmath7-glycine instead results in the @xmath0 phase . \n , scaledwidth=47.0% ]    the structural identification of the @xmath0 phase , previously experimentally observed but not resolved up to now , marks an important achievement for csp and is a key result of our study . \n the search for @xmath1glycine proved very demanding despite it being the experimentally most readily formed polymorph at ambient conditions . in this \n study the @xmath1 phase could not be found even after 20 generations with the standard settings in uspex . \n this difficulty revealed one of the remaining challenges of csp : the effective exploration of the topology of an erratic and vast configuration space . \n indeed , the fully ab - initio scheme advocated for in this work pays for the higher accuracy with a heavy computational cost that makes this effectiveness even more crucial . to improve on this aspect we weighted the random selection of the space group of the candidate structures according to the frequency distribution appearing in known organic crystal structure database [ @xmath38 ( 36.59  % ) , @xmath39 ( 16.92  % ) , @xmath40 ( 11.00  % ) , @xmath41 ( 6.95  % ) , @xmath42 ( 6.35  % ) , @xmath43 ( 4.24  % ) , and uniform otherwise ] @xcite \n this procedure successfully produced the @xmath1 phase at the @xmath44 generation , demonstrating that incorporation of even mild and system unspecific experimental knowledge in the search strategy may have a significant impact to overcome the effectiveness challenge in the most demanding cases . \n indeed if more system specific information is available it can be used to further constrain and guide the phase - space search : limiting the search to the experimentally known , @xmath45 , space group of @xmath1glycine , or fixing the cell shape to its experimental value , resulted in its identification at the @xmath46 and @xmath47 generations , respectively . combining the two constraints resulted in an even quicker discovery at the third generation . \n once the low energy structures are found and examined , the configuration space search can be further instructed to look for certain patterns . in the case of @xmath1glycine \n , it is noteworthy that the crystal building block can be seen as a glycine dimer , with head to tail orientation . \n this feature is not seen in other ambient pressure polymorphs of glycine , and can be speculated to be one of the reasons for the @xmath1 phase not being readily connected with other phases in the energy landscape . \n this correlates with the difficulty of generating the structure during the ea procedure , as well as with its exceptional stability under pressure . instead , \n if the dimer unit is taken as building block in a csp search , the @xmath1 phase is found at the third iteration and new phases such as phase 8 , phase 14 , phase 24 and phase 38 are also discovered . \n hence the difficulty of exploring the @xmath1 phase as well as the finding of new phases only after a dimer unit is employed , underlines the remaining challenges of csp and calls for even more efficient methods for exploring new structures and innovative data analysis applications to guide the search on the go for a full optimization of resources . \n ( see supplementary material fig.s2 - 10 for details of all search attempts ) . \n we presented a fully blind , fully ab initio crystal structure prediction test on glycine , a system that has been examined several times in the past yet never fully grasped . \n a remarkable precision and a broad sampling is obtained in an affordable computational time thanks to last generation van der waals density functionals and evolutionary algorithms at the leading edge . \n the comparison of our results with existing experimental studies enabled us to resolve the so - far unidentified @xmath0 phase a decade after its first experimental observation . \n further analysis of the results of the blind test allowed us to propose several new thermodynamically plausible structures with varying volume , compressibility and polarization . to address the \n experimentally well established but csp - wise challenging @xmath1 phase , we introduced an intuitive sampling strategy based on crystal structure relative frequency found in nature . \n this strategy successfully found this challenging phase and allowed us further insight in the energy landscape . \n overall , the results of our blind test shows us that a reliable crystal structure prediction procedure is possible with incorporation of several complementary recipes to reach success , emphasizing that one - size - fits - all solutions are yet to be discovered . \n fortunately , the leap in precision and sampling capability we have demonstrated with these new generation tools opens new paths for crystal structure prediction with data processing procedures such as clustering algorithms . \n hence we strongly believe ab initio csp as presented here has come a long way and that a new standard for structure prediction for molecular crystals is set , and an interdisciplinary horizon for computational science within this field is now open . \n work supported by the italian miur through the prin 2010 initiative ( prin 20105zztse ) . \n computational resources have been provided by sissa and cineca , italy , and on curie@tgcc -

of the 621  ghz transition , providing a natural explanation for the observational fact that 22  ghz maser emission appears to be a necessary but insufficient condition for 621  ghz maser emission .", "article": "barely fifteen years after the invention of the laboratory maser in 1953  which required a population inversion in the ammonia molecule to be carefully _ engineered _  interstellar masers were _ discovered _ as a remarkable and naturally - occurring phenomenon . \n the @xmath3 transition of water vapor , with a frequency near 22 ghz , was among the first masing transitions detected from an astrophysical source ( the orion molecular cloud ; cheung et al . \n 1969 ) , and has proven to be an extraordinarily useful probe in environments as diverse as interstellar shock waves , circumnuclear gas in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , and the envelopes of evolved stars ( elitzur 1992 ; lo 2005 ; and references therein ) . with brightness temperatures that often exceed @xmath5  k and in extreme cases can exceed @xmath6  k ( e.g. garay , moran & haschick ( 1989 ) , and with linewidths that are often extremely narrow , 22 ghz water masers can be observed with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) . \n the very high angular resolution of such vlbi observations enables proper motion studies of the kinematics of gas outflowing from proto- and evolved stars . \n moreover , trigonometric and geometric / rotational parallaxes can be determined , yielding the distances and motions of star forming regions in our galaxy , in local group galaxies , and in more distant agn ( e.g.  brunthaler et al .  2007 ; \n braatz et al . \n such observations have led to revised estimates of the size , shape and kinematics of the milky way ( e.g.  reid et al . \n 2009 ) , as well as the best evidence yet obtained for the existence of supermassive black holes ( e.g. miyoshi et al .  1995 ) . \n masers directly probe extreme environments ( of density and temperature ) , whose properties can often only be inferred indirectly from other lines .    over the 40 years since the first detection of interstellar water maser emission in the 22 ghz transition , \n several additional interstellar maser transitions have been detected at higher frequencies , some in response to a specific prediction of a population inversion ( menten et al . \n 1990a ) . in the case of pure rotational emissions , \n these comprise the 183 ghz ( waters et al . \n 1980 ) , 321 ghz ( menten et al . \n 1990b ) , 325 ghz \n ( menten et al . \n 1990a ) , 380 ghz ( phillips et al . 1980 ) , 439 ghz ( melnick et al . 1993 ) and 471 ghz ( melnick et al . 1993 ) lines , associated respectively with the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 transitions . \n these transitions are shown in the energy level diagram in figure 1 . \n in addition , several water transitions within the the @xmath131 and 2 vibrationally - excited states have been observed toward the circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars , as have the 437 ghz @xmath14 and 475  ghz 5@xmath15 pure rotational transitions ( melnick et al . \n 1993 ; menten et al . \n 2008 ) . \n the detection of multiple masing transitions has been crucial in elucidating the pumping mechanism responsible for the population inversions and the physical conditions in the masing gas . \n understanding the latter , of course , is crucial to the astrophysical interpretation of maser observations . while the interpretation of the emission observed in a single line ( e.g. the 22 ghz transition ) \n is very geometry dependent , because the non - linear amplification of the radiation strongly favors those sight - lines that happen to possess the greatest velocity coherence , the interpretation of multiline observations is more robust and permits important constraints to be placed upon ( 1 ) the excitation mechanism and ( 2 ) the conditions of temperature and density in the emitting gas . \n the pattern of pure rotational maser transitions observed from interstellar sources appears to confirm an excitation model ( e.g. neufeld & melnick 1991 ) in which collisional pumping , combined with spontaneous radiative decay , leads to the inversion of exactly those transitions that are observed to mase . in evolved stars \n , however , the additional presence of the 437 ghz @xmath14 maser transition suggests that collisional pumping is not the entire story and that radiative pumping by dust continuum radiation is also important . \n quantitative measurements of maser line ratios provide additional constraints . \n for example , the predicted dependence of a maser line ratio upon the temperature and density of the masing gas was used by melnick et al . \n ( 1993 ) to derive a lower limit of 1000 k upon the gas temperature in several observed sources ; this value argued against a model ( elitzur , hollenbach & mckee 1989 ) in which the masers were excited in 400 k material behind a dissociative shock wave , and favored a model ( kaufman & neufeld 1996 ) in which non - dissociative magnetohydrodynamic shocks were the source of the emission . \n the analysis makes the assumption that the maser beam angle is similar for the two transitions that are being compared . \n prior to the launch of the _ herschel space observatory _ ( pilbratt et al .  2010 ) , \n the observational data on pure rotational water masers had been limited to transitions of frequency less than 500 ghz , largely because of atmospheric absorption . \n the hifi spectrometer on _ herschel _ ( de grauuw et al . \n 2010 ) , however , provides the opportunity of expanding the available data set by the addition of higher frequency transitions that promise to increase our leverage on the pumping mechanism and the physical conditions in the maser - emitting gas . to date , _ herschel _ observations of oxygen - rich evolved stars have led to the detection of two additional water maser transitions : ( 1 ) the @xmath0 transition at 620.701  ghz ( detected toward vy cma by harwit et al . \n 2010 , and toward w hya , ik tau and irc+10011 by justtanont et al .  2012 ) ; and ( 2 ) the @xmath16 transition at 970.315  ghz ( detected toward w hya and ik tau by justtanont et al . \n to our knowledge , neither maser has previously been observed from interstellar gas . in this paper , we report the first detection of 621  ghz water maser emission from _ interstellar _ gas , obtained with _ \n herschel_/hifi in mapping observations of the orion - kl region . \n in addition , we report the detection of 621  ghz water maser emission obtained serendipitously in single pointings toward the w49n star - forming region and the orion south molecular cloud . \n our _ herschel _ observations of orion - kl were carried out on 2011 march 11 as part of the `` orion small maps '' subprogram within the hexos guaranteed time key program ( gtkp ; p.i . \n , e.  bergin ) . \n we used the `` heterodyne instrument for the infrared '' ( hifi ) , in `` on - the - fly mapping '' ( otf ) mode , to obtain a nyquist - sampled map consisting of a 6 by 8 rectangular array of pointings spaced by @xmath17 in r.a .  and \n the map center was located at offset ( @xmath18 relative to orion - kl . \n ( all offsets given in this paper are relative to @xmath19 ( j2000 ) , the position we adopt for orion - kl . ) \n the reference position for the otf mapping observations , at offset @xmath20 , was chosen to be devoid of known molecular emission . \n the observations were carried out in the upper sideband of mixer band 1b , using the wbs spectrometer , which provides an oversampled channel spacing of 0.5 mhz ( 0.27 km / s at a frequency of 621 ghz ) , roughly one - half the effective resolution . \n the absolute frequency calibration is accurate to 100  khz ( roefsema et al . \n the beam size was 34@xmath21 ( hpbw ) , and the absolute pointing accuracy is @xmath22 . \n two concatenated astronomical observation requests ( aors ) were used to obtain two separate maps , with a small relative offset ( @xmath23 ) chosen to make the center of the h polarization beam for one map coincident with the center of the v polarization beam for the other map . as discussed in  3 , \n the goal of acquiring two separate maps in this manner was to obtain a measurement of any linear polarization in the maser feature . \n as summarized in table 1 , the total duration of each aor was 1987  s , with an on - source integration time of 420  s , which yielded individual spectra with an r.m.s . \n noise of 62 mk ( on the scale of antenna temperature and for a 1.1 mhz channel width ) . \n the _ herschel _ \n data on orion - kl were reduced using standard methods in the herschel interactive processing environment ( hipe ; ott 2010 ) , version 10.0    on 2011 march 21 , ten days after the _ herschel _ observations of orion - kl were performed , we used the effelsberg 100  m telescope to carry out observations of the 22.23508 ghz @xmath3 transition , with the goal of determining the 621 ghz / 22 ghz line flux ratio as a constraint upon models for the maser emission mechanism . here , we obtained a map , centered at offset @xmath24 , consisting of a 9 by 9 square array of pointings spaced by @xmath25 in r.a .  and \n the beam size was 41@xmath21 ( hpbw ) , and the frequency resolution was 6.1  khz , corresponding to a velocity resolution of 0.082  km / s . \n the observations were performed using the k - band receiver at the prime focus of the 100  m telescope , with an observing time of 1.0 min per position . in calibrating the spectra , we applied corrections for the atmospheric attenuation and for the dependence of the telescope gain on the elevation . \n the calibration factor was determined by the observation of suitable calibration sources like ngc7027 and 3c286 ( taking into account the significant linear polarization of the latter ) . \n in addition to the mapping observations of orion - kl that are the primary subject of this paper , we have also identified two additional _ \n spectra that show narrow and/or time variable 621 ghz features suggestive of maser action . \n our observations of high - mass star - forming region w49n were carried out at three separate epochs , as part of the prismas gtkp ( p.i , m.  gerin ) . \n these observations had the primary goal of measuring foreground absorption in nearby spectral lines of @xmath26 , but included the 621  ghz line within the bandpass . for each epoch , \n the relevant data were acquired in 3 aors obtained with slightly different lo settings . \n the aor numbers , dates of observation , beam center position , duration of the observations , and rms noise achieved are listed in table 1 . \n the data reduction methods that we adopted within the prismas gtkp have been described , for example , by neufeld et al . \n our observations of the hot core in the orion south molecular cloud were performed as part of a spectral line survey in the hexos gtkp . \n the data of present interest were acquired in a full spectral scan of band 1b , in which the 621  ghz transition was observed ( in either the upper or the lower sideband ) at 19 separate lo settings . \n the data reduction methods that we adopted for spectral scans within the hexos gtkp have been described by bergin et al . \n ( 2010 ) , and further details of the observations appear in table 1 . \n ancillary 22 ghz maser observations were performed using the effelsberg 100 m telescope toward w49n and orion s on 2012 oct 1 and 2012 sep 28 , respectively . \n because water masers are well - known to exhibit significant variability on timescales of months , our comparison of these non - contemporaneous 22 ghz and 621 ghz spectra must be interpreted with caution ; indeed , as described in  3 below , time variability in the maser emission is readily inferred from a comparison of the w49n 621 ghz data acquired at the 3 epochs . \n in figure 2 , we show the 621 ghz @xmath0 line spectra obtained toward orion - kl . \n the spectra are autoscaled , with the color of each border indicating the vertical scaling in accordance with the color bars on the left , and the two linear polarizations are shown in separate panels . \n the lsr velocity range shown in each panel is 20 to + 30 km / s . \n analogous results are shown for the 22 ghz @xmath3 transition in figure 3 . \n clearly , the strongest 621  ghz line emission originates in the vicinity of orion - kl , and exhibits a broad profile characteristic of high - lying ( and non - masing ) rotational transitions of water observed by _ \n ( melnick et al .  2010 ) . \n however , to the northwest of orion - kl , close to the shocked material associated with orion h@xmath1 peak 1 ( beckwith et al .  1978 ) , a narrow emission feature is clearly present . \n this feature is most apparent in the four spectra obtained closest to offset @xmath27 , the average of which is shown in figure 4 ( e.g. upper panel , blue histogram ) . the 22 ghz maser emission , by contrast , is dominated by multiple narrow emission components , the strongest lying in the 7 to 13 km / s lsr velocity range ; see figure 4 ( upper panel , red histogram ) . in the lower panel of figure 4 \n , we compare the 621 ghz and 22 ghz line emissions observed in the vicinity of @xmath27 for the 9 to 14 km / s lsr velocity range . in this panel , \n the two polarizations are shown separately for each transition , and a broad emission component has been subtracted from the 621 ghz line profile . \n although the 621  ghz and 22  ghz spectra are dissimilar outside this velocity range  the 22  ghz spectrum exhibiting a strong narrow feature near @xmath28  km / s that is absent in the 621  ghz spectrum , for example  the spectra are very similar within the 10  13 km / s velocity range . and which are expected to account for more than @xmath29 of the observed emission , ) lie at frequency shifts of @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 khz relative to the mean @xmath3 line frequency , corresponding to velocity shifts of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . \n thus , even if departures from lte lead to large changes in the hyperfine line ratios , the maximum resulting velocity shift is at most 0.5 km / s ; hyperfine splitting of the higher - frequency 621  ghz transitions is completely negligible . ] furthermore , for both lines , the spectra obtained in the two polarizations are very similar . given the systematic uncertainties ( associated , for example , with possible differences between the telescope beam profiles for the two polarizations ) , these data provide no compelling evidence for polarization . \n a more detailed study of polarization in this source , which makes use of additional observations obtained at multiple spacecraft roll angles to measure the linear polarization of the 621 ghz maser transition , is currently under way ( jones et al .  2013 , private communication ) \n the upper panel of figure 5 shows the 22  ghz spectrum obtained toward w49n ( red ) , along with the 621  ghz spectra obtained at three epochs spanning two years ( see table 1 ) . \n because the 621 ghz transition was not specifically targeted but rather observed serendipitously in observations with a different primary purpose , we did not perform near - contemporaneous 22  ghz observations . \n thus , the 22 ghz spectrum shown in figure 5 was acquired 170 days after the last 621  ghz observation , making a detailed comparison between the transitions difficult . on the other hand , \n the availability of 621  ghz line observations at three separate epochs has allowed us to detect unequivocal variability in the line profile . \n most notably , a narrow emission feature near @xmath36  km / s was present in the 2011 observation but absent in the 2010 and 2012 observations ; and the line profile in the @xmath37  km / s range shows clear variability throughout the period covered by the three epochs . \n this variability , which can result from small changes in the ( negative ) optical depth along the sight - line to the observer , is characteristic of high - gain maser emission from a turbulent medium . \n four interferometric studies provide information about the spatial distribution of the 22  ghz water maser emission in w49n over a 30-year time period ( moran et al . \n 1973 ; walker , matsakis , & garcia - barreto 1982 ; gwinn , moran & reid 1992 ; mcgrath , goss & de  pree 2004 ; performed in 197071 , 1978 , 198082 , and 199899 , respectively ) . \n they indicate that 99% of the 22  ghz maser flux is associated with the ultracompact hii regions designated g1 and g2 ( dreher et al .  1984 ) , and originates within 5@xmath38 of the beam center position adopted for our _ herschel _ ( and effelsberg ) observations . the remainder of the observed 22 ghz maser emission originates from a region @xmath39 northeast of the beam center . given these offsets , the _ herschel _ beam size ( 34@xmath38 ) , and the absolute pointing accuracy ( 2@xmath38 ) \n , we find it very unlikely that the observed 621  ghz variability could be the result of pointing errors . the only way that pointing errors could falsely indicate variability is if a very strong 621 ghz maser emission feature were located in the far wing of the _ herschel _ beam profile ( where the beam response is a strong function of offset ) ; such an emission feature would lie outside the region from which 22 ghz emission has been detected in the interferometric studies discussed above .    in the case of the 621  ghz spectra \n obtained toward w49n , the relative contribution of maser and non - maser emission is hard to disentangle , at least based on the data currently in hand . while it is tempting to interpret the spectra as a superposition of narrow maser features on top of a broad ( @xmath40  km / s wide ) plateau of thermal line emission , the 22  ghz spectrum has an entirely similar appearance . in the case of the 22  ghz transition , \n however , the expected contribution of thermal emission is negligible ; indeed , the interferometric studies referenced above show that the broad pedestal apparent in single - dish observations is - in reality - a superposition of numerous compact and narrow emission features within the beam . \n the lower panel of figure 5 shows the spectra obtained toward orion south in ( non - contemponeous ) observations of the 621  ghz and 22  ghz transitions . \n the 621  ghz spectrum shows a single prominent narrow feature of width @xmath41  km / s ( fwhm ) in near coincidence with one of three narrow 22  ghz features . \n the 621  ghz linewidth is considerably narrower than that ( @xmath42  km / s ) measured at this position for non - masing spectral lines  such as those of h@xmath1cl@xmath43 ( neufeld et al . \n 2012 ) and cn ( rodriguez - franco et al .  2001 ) , for example  and has its centroid at a lower lsr velocity ( @xmath44  km / s versus of 7.2  km / s ) . \n the strongest 22 ghz emission in orion south was detected in to 0 to + 17  km  s@xmath45 lsr velocity range , but weaker features are present over a wider interval from @xmath46 to @xmath47  km  s@xmath45 ; the latter range is somewhat wider than that obtained by gaume et al .  1998 ( @xmath48 to @xmath49  km  s@xmath45 ; \n see their fig . 5 and table 2 ) in sensitive very large array observations performed in 1991 . \n the phenomenon of maser amplification in w49n and orion s is not unique to water . \n maser emission from hydroxyl radicals has been long been studied in w49n , but is believed to require different excitation conditions ( e.g. mader et al .  1975 ) . \n in orion south , voronkov et al . \n ( 2005 ) have reported 6.7  ghz @xmath50 emissions that are likely masing . \n in table 2 , we present the 22  ghz and 621  ghz photon luminosities for the three sources we have observed , each computed with the assumption that the emission is isotropic and for adopted distances of 414  pc ( orion - kl and orion - s ; menten et al .  2007 ) and 11400  pc ( w49n : gwinn , moran & reid 1992 ) . as we have noted in  3 above , however , particular velocity components that are clearly present in the 22  ghz spectra are sometimes unaccompanied by detectable 621  ghz line emission ( though the converse is never true ) , suggesting that the requirements for strong 621  ghz maser amplification are more stringent than those for strong 22  ghz maser action . \n thus , the source - averaged 621  ghz/22  ghz line ratios may be considerable smaller than those applying to specific 621  ghz emission features . \n accordingly , we have also computed luminosities and line ratios for specific velocity ranges in which strong 621  ghz emission is observed from orion - kl and orion - s . \n furthermore , as will be discussed further in  4.1.2 below , our mapping observations of orion - kl indicate that _ even when integrated over a narrow range of lsr velocities _ , the 621  ghz / 22  ghz line ratio varies spatially .      in figure 6 , we present channel maps for the 22 ghz line emissions detected from orion - kl , with the location of the peak intensity marked by a red diamond , and the channel - averaged peak flux ( in jy / beam ) listed in red near the top of each panel . \n the two strongest velocity components , at @xmath28  km / s and @xmath51  km / s show peak intensities near @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively , positions separated by 26@xmath38 , more than one - half the effelberg hpbw ( 41@xmath38 ) . \n km / s maser emission feature can be identified with a bursting maser feature observed using vlbi by hirota et al . \n ( 2011 ) and located at offset @xmath54 . \n this feature , which brightened dramatically in 2011 february ( tolmachev 2011 ) , is associated the orion compact ridge . \n hirota et al . \n suggested that the bursting maser emission arises in shocked gas associated with the interaction of an outflow with ambient material , and identified radio source i ( plambeck et al . \n 2009 ) as the likely origin of the outflow . \n the latter is located roughly 3400 au northeast of the bursting maser source , and is a site of well - studied sio maser emission ( e.g. matthews et al . \n ] moreover , as shown in figure 7 ( yellow contours ) , the peak 22  ghz line intensity integrated over the 10  13 km / s velocity range ( upper panel ) is clearly separated also from the location of the peak 621  ghz emission ( lower panel ) in the same velocity range , despite the similarity of the spectral line profiles shown in figure 4 ( lower panel ) . \n one intepretation of this separation is that the 22  ghz maser emission in this velocity range is actually the sum of two ( or more ) spatially distinct components , the stronger of which is unaccompanied by 621 ghz maser emission .    to test this hypothesis , \n we have carefully compared the 10  13 km / s 22  ghz channel map with the beam profile for the effelsberg telescope . \n the latter was measured at 22 ghz by observing the compact continuum source 3c84 at the prime focus . \n the beam response function is shown in figure 8 ( black contours , upper panel ) , superposed on red contours indicating the best fit gaussian ( with a hpbw of @xmath55 ) . in each case , contours are labeled as a percentage of the peak response . \n the beam profile is reasonably well - approximated by a gaussian , with deviations less than @xmath56 of the peak intensity . \n the lower panel shows a grayscale representation of the residuals relative to the best - fit gaussian , with gray levels separated by 1@xmath57 of the peak intensity and the blue contour indicating a residual of zero . having determined the best - fit to the 22  ghz beam profile , we subtracted that beam profile \n centered at the centroid of the strongest 22  ghz maser emission ( at offset [ @xmath58,@xmath59 ) and rotated as appropriate for the mean parallactic angle of the orion - kl observations ( 19@xmath60 ) to 27@xmath60 ]  from the observed profile of the 22  ghz maser emission for @xmath62  km / s . the grayscale background in figure 7 ( both panels ) represents the result of that subtraction , which we will henceforth refer to as the  22 ghz residual \" ( i.e. the residual with respect to the intensity expected for a point source at offset [ @xmath58,@xmath59 ) . here , \n adjacent grayscale levels are separated by 1000  k  km / s , corresponding to @xmath56 of the peak 22  ghz line intensity integrated over the 10  13 km / s velocity range . \n the spatial distribution of the  22 ghz residual \" matches that of the 621  ghz line emission reasonably well , supporting the interpretation introduced at the of end the previous paragraph . \n thus , the ratio of the luminosity of the 621  ghz line to that of the 22 ghz _ \n residual _ provides our best estimate of the true maser line ratio in the 621  ghz - emitting gas : 0.28 ( table 2 ) . \n it is difficult to provide a quantitative estimate of the systematic uncertainty in the 22 ghz residual ; the latter depends upon the reproducibility of the effelsberg beam profile shown in figure 8 , an issue that is not presently constrained by observations . \n we note , however , that the peak flux in the residual is @xmath63 of the peak flux in the 10  13 km / s velocity range . by comparison , the maximum deviations from a gaussian in the beam response function ( blue contours in figure 8) are only 5@xmath57 of the peak response . \n this suggests that the likely error in our estimate of the residual flux is at most 25@xmath57 , even under the conservative assumption that the deviations from a gaussian profile have locations that vary from one observation to the next . \n in addition to comparing our observations of 621  ghz water emission with single - dish 22  ghz observations ( performed nearly contemporaneously ) , we may also compare them with interferometric observations of the 22  ghz maser transition . \n unfortunately , we are unaware of any such observations of the orion region performed in recent years . \n the only published map of 22  ghz maser features to cover the region of narrow 621  ghz emission is that presented by genzel et al . \n ( 1981 ) , based upon observations performed in 197779 ; more recent observations reported by gaume et al . \n 1998 do not extend far enough to the north . \n we have , however , located a set of more recent unpublished data , acquired using very large array ( vla ) on 1996 march 15 and covering the region of interest , in the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) archive . \n our reduction of these data is described in the appendix , where we tabulate the velocities and positions of 339 maser spots of peak flux density exceeding 1 jy that were identified in our analysis . in figure 7 , \n blue , cyan and red circles show the locations of maser spots with lsr velocities in the 10  11 , 11  12 , and 12  13  km / s ranges , with the size of each circle indicating the peak flux on a logarithmic scale . \n figure 7 indicates that a strong 22  ghz maser counterpart was indeed present at a location and velocity close to that of the narrow 621  ghz emission , despite the 15 year time period that separates the two observing epochs .      to help interpret the observed maser line ratios , we have updated the maser excitation models described by ( neufeld & melnick 1991 ; hereafter nm91 ) to make use of recent calculations of the rate coefficients for excitation of @xmath64 by h@xmath1 ( daniel , dubernet , & grosjean 2011 , extrapolated for additional states of h@xmath1o using the artificial neural network method introduced by neufeld 2010 ) . as in nm91 \n , we performed a parameter study in which the equations of statistical equilibrium for the h@xmath1o level populations were solved for a grid of temperatures , @xmath65 , h@xmath1 densities , @xmath66 , and water column densities , @xmath67 . \n these calculations were performed for a medium with a large velocity gradient , with use of a standard escape probability method to account for radiative trapping . \n these calculations yield two key quantities for any masing transition : ( 1 ) the line optical depth in the unsaturated limit , and ( 2 ) the line luminosity in the saturated limit . \n we computed the negative sobolev optical depth , along the direction of the velocity gradient , that would be obtained without the effect of maser amplification . \n these values are plotted in figure 9 , as a function of @xmath68 and @xmath65 , for four values of @xmath67 . here , \n red contours show results for the 22  ghz transition , and blue contours those for the 621  ghz transition . \n for both transitions , the sobolev optical depth is more negative than 3 within large regions of the parameter space plotted in figure 9 . at high densities \n , the level populations inevitably tend to their local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) values , maser action is quenched , and the optical depths become positive ( in regions to the right of the contours labeled zero . ) as expected , the lower - frequency 22  ghz transition can maintain its population inversion up to higher gas densities than the 621  ghz transition , allowing for the possibility of maser amplification of the 22  ghz transition unaccompanied by maser emission in the 621  ghz transition . \n as discussed in  3 , _ this possibility is clearly realized in the observations reported here_. for example , the strong 14.5  km / s 22  ghz feature in orion south shows no detectable 621  ghz emission ; the implied upper limit on the 621  ghz/22  ghz line ratio is @xmath69 ) . at high densities \n ( e.g. @xmath70 at a temperature of 1000  k ) , the maser line ratio depends strongly upon temperature and density : thus , relatively modest variations in the physical conditions can lead to large changes in the emergent line ratio . \n the optical depths plotted in figure 9 are the values along sightlines _ \n parallel _ to the direction of the velocity gradient ( i.e. in the direction of _ minimum _ velocity coherence . ) in plane - parallel geometry , the optical depth of a masing transition formally approaches @xmath71 as the inclination of the ray approaches @xmath72 , although in reality the magnitude of the optical depth is limited by departures from plane - parallel geometry ( such as curvature in a shocked molecular shell , for example ) . \n nevertheless , the maximum optical depth in a typical interstellar region can easily exceed the sobolev optical depth by an order of magnitude : thus , a sobolev optical depth of 3 can easily produce a maser gain of @xmath73 . \n gain factors of this magnitude will reduce the population inversion , leading to maser saturation . \n we computed the maximum photon luminosity that can be obtained under conditions of saturation , with the use of the formalism discussed in nm91 . \n in essence , this is the maximum rate of stimulated emission that can occur without eliminating the population inversion . taking the ratio of these luminosities for the two transitions yields the results shown in figure 10 . \n if the 22  ghz and 621  ghz transition are both saturated and are similarly beamed , this luminosity ratio can be compared with the observed values in rightmost column of table 2 . \n this comparison indicates that the observed luminosity of the 621  ghz maser transition can be accounted for in the same collisional pumping model that has proved successful in explaining other masing transitions of interstellar water . in no velocity range , in any source , does the 621  ghz/22  ghz maser luminosity ratio exceed 1.16 ; given the likelihood of time variability ( in w49n and orion south where the observations were non - contemporaneous ) and other uncertainties associated with maser beaming , _ this value can be regarded as consistent with the range of values ( up to 0.8 ) predicted by the collisional excitation model_. unfortunately , and unlike some of the other submillimeter maser transitions ( e.g.  melnick et al . 1993 ) , the 621  ghz transition does not provide strong constraints on the gas temperature ; thus the observed 621  ghz/22  ghz line ratios are consistent with either 400  k gas behind dissociative j - type shocks ( e.g. elitzur , hollenbach & mckee 1989 ) , or the hotter gas that can arise behind non - dissociative shocks ( kaufman & neufeld 1993 ) . a search for maser emission in the @xmath12 ( 471  ghz ) and @xmath11 ( 439  ghz ) transitions of water could provide a stronger constraint on the gas temperature , as these transitions can only be pumped significantly at temperatures @xmath74  k or higher ( melnick et al . \n we have performed _ herschel_/hifi mapping observations of the 621  ghz @xmath0 transition of ortho - h@xmath1o within a @xmath2 region encompassing the kleinmann - low nebula in orion , and pointed observations of that transition toward the orion south condensation and the w49n region of high - mass star formation . \n we also obtained ancillary observations of the 22.23508  ghz @xmath3 water maser transition using the effelsberg 100 m telescope . in the case of orion - kl , \n the 621  ghz and 22  ghz observations were carried out nearly contemporaneously ( within 10 days of each other ) . \n the key results of these observations are as follows :    \\1 . in all three sources , \n the 621  ghz water line emission shows clear evidence for strong maser amplification . in both orion - kl and orion south , \n the observations reveal a narrow ( @xmath4 km / s fwhm ) emission feature , superposed in the case of orion - kl on broad thermal line emission , with a velocity centroid that is consistent with that of an observed 22  ghz maser feature . in the case of w49n - for \n which observations were available at three epochs spanning a two year period - observed variability in the 621  ghz line profile provides further evidence for maser action . \n \\2 . in all three sources , 621 \n ghz maser emission is apparently always accompanied by 22  ghz maser emission . \n our mapping observations of orion - kl reveal a spatial offset between the 621  ghz maser emission and the 22  ghz maser emission occuring at the same velocity . \n however , a careful analysis of the spatial distribution of the observed 22 ghz maser emission reveals two spatially - distinct components , the weaker of which is spatially coincident with the 621  ghz maser emission . \n the observed 621  ghz/22  ghz line ratios are always consistent with a maser pumping model in which the population inversions arise from the combined effects of collisional excitation and spontaneous radiative decay . \n the observed line ratios do not place strong constraints on the gas temperature , and thus the inferred physical conditions can plausibly arise behind either dissociative or non - dissociative shocks . \n the collisional excitation model predicts that the 22  ghz population inversion will be quenched at higher densities than that of the 621  ghz transition , providing a natural explanation for the observational fact that 22  ghz maser emission appears to be a necessary but insufficient condition for 621  ghz maser emission . \n hifi has been designed

 jones and collaborators for providing us with a draft of their results prior to publication . \n we have downloaded , from the nrao archive , a set of 22 ghz h@xmath1o maser data targeting orion - kl . \n the observations were performed on 1996 march 15 with the vla in its c configuration , as part of a project ( ac443 ) that targeted seven sources . the total observing time for that project was 3 hours , of which 16 minutes was devoted to on - source observations of orion - kl . \n the extragalactic radio source 0605 - 085 was used as a phase calibrator . in the absence of any non - variable radio source that could be used for absolute flux calibration , we established the flux density scale by assuming a flux density for 0605 - 085 of 1.7 jy , the value measured in 1997 december by ( kovalev et al . \n the spectral - line observations  carried out with the 1.3 cm receivers  employed a single intermediate frequency band ( if ) mode with total of 127 channels , each of width 49 khz , corresponding to 0.7 km s@xmath45 . \n the central channel was set to a local standard of rest ( lsr ) velocity of 10 km s@xmath45 for the 22  ghz transition , providing a total lsr velocity coverage from @xmath75 to + 52  km / s . \n the data were reduced with astronomical image processing system ( aips ) software package . after a standard flux and phase calibration \n , we used the strongest maser emission feature - which has a flux of 1500 jy and a v@xmath76 of 4.6 km s@xmath45 - for self calibration , and then applied the solutions to all the other channels . \n the fwhm primary beam of individual vla antennas is @xmath77 2@xmath78 . \n we imaged and cleaned the data by applying the natural weighting of the uv data , which resulted in a synthesized beam of size 1.3  @xmath79  1.0 ( fwhm ) at position angle 23@xmath80 . \n we produced a 2048  @xmath792048 maser image cube , with a cell size of 0.1  @xmath79  0.1 . \n we then used the aips task sad to detect maser emissions with peak intensity higher than 5 times the r.m.s . \n noise level . for line channels in the orion - kl region that are not limited by dynamic range , the r.m.s . \n noise level was @xmath77 0.12 jy .    in table 3 \n , we list the parameters obtained for 339 maser emission spots , all selected to satisfy the following criteria : flux @xmath81 1 jy , signal noise ratio ( snr ) @xmath81 10 , and dynamic range @xmath81 0.01 . \n ( in other words , for channels with peak flux greater than 100 jy , we used a flux cutoff of 0.01 @xmath79 the peak flux ) . \n figure 11 shows distribution of maser spots , with the color and symbol size representing lsr velocity and peak flux respectively . for comparision with \n the 621 ghz maser feature observed toward orion - kl , we show in figure 12 the 22 ghz maser emission integrated over the 10    13  km s@xmath45 velocity range . \n the letters a , b , c , d , e and f mark subregions from which the spectra presented in

ii simulation @xcite , to investigate the incidence of satellite alignments in that large @xmath3 volume of a @xmath0-cdm universe . \n they concluded that due to the spatial correlation between satellites in @xmath0-cdm , structures similar to that observed are relatively common , arising in approximately 2% of the halos they investigated . \n the aim of the present paper is to examine the validity of the bb14 analysis , and to extend our earlier analysis to make better use of the accurate kinematic information available for the real satellites . in section  [ sec : sample_selection ] , we discuss how the samples were selected from the simulation . \n section  [ sec : results ] presents the analysis and results , and conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conclusions ] . \n we select sub - halos from the millennium - ii simulation , using the @xcite catalog which was scaled to the wmap year 7 analysis . \n the semi - analytic recipes that were applied to the dark matter simulation provide a wealth of predicted physical properties for galaxies that reside within the dark matter halos . \n since we are interested in selecting systems similar to m31 , we follow bb14 and pick all halos in the redshift @xmath4 snapshot that have virial masses between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , mass - weighted age @xmath7 , and whose neighbors within @xmath8 have a baryonic component less massive than @xmath9 . \n ( we define the baryonic mass to be the sum of the stellar and cold gas components ) . a total of 1141 such hosts are found . \n in addition to those bb14 selection criteria , we apply the following three criteria to select hosts that are reasonably similar to m31 . \n we require that the hosts have baryonic masses in the range @xmath10@xmath11 ( this leaves 1024 galaxies ) , and we require that the group that the host galaxy resides in should have mass @xmath12 , a 95% upper limit to the mass of the local group @xcite ( leaving 885 galaxies ) . to ensure that the m31 analog , as in reality , is the dominant galaxy within the survey region , we finally reject hosts that have a companion within @xmath8 that possesses @xmath13 of their baryonic mass . \n these cuts yield a sample of 679 host galaxies within the millennium - ii simulation .    figure  [ fig : observations]a shows the observed distribution of the 15 satellites of m31 that are confined to a narrow plane . \n it can be immediately appreciated that the plane lies almost perfectly edge - on from our viewing point . \n the side view is displayed in figure  [ fig : observations]b , using the most likely value of the line of sight distances measured by @xcite . \n the arrows mark the measured line of sight velocity @xcite , with the red arrows showing those satellites that have the same sense of rotation .    to reproduce the observational configuration , we place ourselves in the simulation at a random position @xmath14 distant from the host galaxy ( equivalent to the milky way - m31 distance , @xcite ) , with a random camera angle . \n we initially select all the sub - halos within the millennium - ii simulation that lie within @xmath8 of the chosen host and that have stellar mass @xmath15 ( as proposed by bb14 ) , to which we then apply the pandas spatial selection function .    within the pandas area shown in figure  [ fig : observations]a , \n 27 satellites are known ( beyond @xmath16 ) , of which 15 are narrowly aligned in the thin plane discussed by @xcite . to approximate this observed sample , we select in the simulation the brightest 27 satellites that are visible within the pandas field of view . \n if there are less than 27 satellites within this field of view , we discard the viewing position and draw a new one .    using exactly the same procedure as was applied to the real data in @xcite \n , we calculate the pole of the plane that has the lowest perpendicular rms dispersion ( i.e. the thinnest plane ) for any sub - sample of 15 satellites . in a coordinate system \n where @xmath17 points east , @xmath18 points north and @xmath19 points along the line of sight vector to m31 ( i.e. as shown in figures  [ fig : observations]b and [ fig : observations]d ) , the pole of the observed structure points towards @xmath20 . if the pole of the lowest rms plane , as seen from the randomly - chosen viewpoint , lies within @xmath21 of the pole of the real plane , we store this host and its sample of satellites ; otherwise a new viewing position is randomly drawn . \n if no sample is found after @xmath22 random draws of the viewing position , we discard the host . \n this procedure is repeated 12 times , so as to obtain ( in the best cases ) 12 different views of each of the 679 host galaxies \n . cases where a new viewing position of the same host coincided within @xmath23 to one previously calculated were discarded , as we considered such configurations to be `` repeats '' of the previous solutions ) of satellites , meaning that different sub - samples are selected from different viewing positions . \n while our procedure gives rise to identical satellite sub - samples in 1.2% of the random draws , the @xmath24 separation requirement still means that these provide different line of sight velocity projections ( used in figure  [ fig : angular_momentum ] ) . in 76% of the draws \n more than @xmath25 of the satellites are different . \n hence the multiple views help build up better statistics . ] .    in figures  [ fig : observations]c and [ fig : observations]d we overplot all the sub - samples of 15 satellites found around the host galaxies in the way described above . \n the samples have been rotated so that the viewpoint lies at @xmath26 . by construction , \n the random samples have the same orientation as the data . \n our main motivation to force the alignments to be edge - on was to be able to compare the radial velocity information on the satellites directly to the simulations , but this also automatically corrects for the inclination - dependent detection bias in pandas @xcite , and it also avoids the issue that rotation of a structure aligned perpendicular to the line of sight would not have been detected . \n nevertheless , tests show that forcing this orientation does not substantially alter the results below . \n the semi - analytic modeling of @xcite differentiates normal galaxies from `` orphans '' ; the latter being systems whose parent subhalo is no longer resolved . \n it is possible that many of these orphans are tidally disrupted , and that they are hence not directly comparable to the observed dwarf galaxies . despite these concerns \n , we will first assume that the orphan satellites represent structures that can be reliably compared to real dwarf galaxies ( this is an assumption that bb14 considered ) . \n however , we noticed that in the millennium - ii simulation , many of the orphans are spatially clustered around massive sub - halos . \n we decided to reject all the orphan satellites that were next to a massive , non - orphan , satellite , closer than twice the radius of the stellar disk of the non - orphan satellite . \n this is justified on the grounds that in reality it is unlikely that such objects would have been identified ( they would be very hard to distinguish from their companion ) . \n additionally , we reject orphan satellites that are both closer than @xmath27 ( which corresponds approximately to the line of sight distance uncertainty for the best measured dwarf galaxies ) and that have space velocities @xmath28 from a non - orphan satellite , since observationally we would consider such objects to be tidal debris . \n this is the sample that was displayed previously in figures  [ fig : observations]c and [ fig : observations]d . \n one notices immediately from a visual comparison of panels ( b ) and ( d ) that the sample of simulated satellites that includes orphans is significantly more centrally - concentrated than the real satellites , so clearly the extent of the plane is an important property to attempt to reproduce , in addition to its thinness . \n bb14 decided to parametrize the radial extent via the rms dispersion within the plane ( `` rms parallel '' ) , which we calculate as the sum of the squares of the distances in the plane _ from the host galaxy_. in figure  [ fig : parameters]a we show this parameter plotted against the plane thickness ( `` rms perpendicular '' ) . \n let us define `` condition 1 '' to be the requirement that the simulated systems should be thinner than the observed structure ( @xmath29 ) , `` condition 2 '' that they should be spatially more extended than the observations ( @xmath30 ) , and `` condition 3 '' that 13 or more out of the subsamples of 15 satellites share the same sense of rotation . \n we find that 2% of the systems @xmath31 conform to conditions 1 and 2 ( crosses in panel ( a ) ) , but only 3 out of 7757 simulated systems ( 0.04% ) conform to conditions 1,2 and 3 ( crosses in panel ( c ) ) . \n if instead we discard all the orphan satellites , we obtain the parameter distributions displayed in panels ( b ) and ( d ) of figure  [ fig : parameters ] . in this case \n not a single system within the millennium - ii simulation out of a sample of 4974 is more extreme than the m31 satellite structure ( upper limit of @xmath32% ) . \n note that we have been very conservative in the selection , and have not counted any system in which we could not find 27 satellites of which 15 are in an edge - on configuration ( which is why the number of systems in the right panels of figure  [ fig : parameters ] is lower than in the left panels ) . \n an interesting and useful additional view of the parameter space of the properties of the satellite structure is given in figure  [ fig : angular_momentum ] . \n since we deliberately enforced the simulated alignments to be seen with the same orientation as the observations , we can directly compare the line of sight velocities of the satellites with the real measurements . \n in reality we do not have access to the proper motions of the satellites , neither do we have reliable total mass estimates , so we can not measure their total angular momentum . \n however , it is possible to calculate the minimum specific angular momentum , @xmath33 , simply by using the line of sight velocities and taking the unknown transverse motions to be zero . \n exactly the same statistic can be calculated for the simulated satellite galaxies , so the comparison should be very robust . \n in many of the simulated systems , there are a few satellites with extreme values of @xmath33 . to avoid being dominated by such outliers \n , we chose to adopt ( the absolute value of ) the median of @xmath33 as our statistic . \n this parameter is displayed along with the rms thickness in figure  [ fig : angular_momentum ] , for which we define a further `` condition 4 '' : that the simulated systems should have median @xmath34 , the value of the @xmath33 in the real data , which implies that bulk motion is not likely to be important for the present discussion . ] . \n the bottom panels show the result of applying conditions 1 to 4 to the simulated systems . if we discount orphan satellites , there are no structures in the millennium - ii simulations that compare to what is seen in m31 , but if we allow orphans , 2 out of 7757 systems ( 0.03% ) are more extreme in their thinness , radial extent and kinematic properties than the real structure around andromeda . \n it is interesting to inspect these two cases closely . \n both systems contain very massive satellites , with virial masses of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , representing mass fractions of 1@xmath375 and 1@xmath373 , and with baryonic masses of @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( baryonic mass fractions of 1@xmath377 and 1@xmath374 ) , respectively . \n furthermore , each of these halos has an accompanying compact entourage of orphan companions ( unlike the spread - out real system ) , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : observations]d , where we plot the positions and velocities of one of these systems . \n finally , in both cases , the massive companion is approaching the host for the first time . \n this suggests the possibility that the observed structure in m31 is due to the accretion of such a system , and indeed the baryonic masses listed above seem to be in reasonable agreement with that of m33 , which has a stellar mass of @xmath40@xmath41 and a total gas mass of @xmath42 @xcite . \n it should nevertheless be kept in mind that these accretions of a massive satellite galaxy with a tight sub - system of their own are _ extremely rare _ events in the millennium - ii simulations . \n note also that in reality m33 does not partake in the observed planar alignment . \n what is the origin of the discrepancy between the conclusions of our work and bb14 ? \n the limitation with their study is that when they examine the kinematics of the alignments , they only use one of the structural parameters ( @xmath43 ) , not both ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) . \n once this error is corrected , our results and theirs are surprisingly consistent ( i.e. , our more conservative selection of hosts and the proper pandas spatial selection function applied to the satellites do not substantially affect the result ) : both studies measure a @xmath45% occurrence rate% joint probability only if conditions 2 and 3 are independent . ] . \n we have carefully reanalyzed the large - scale `` millennium - ii '' @xmath0-cdm simulation , searching for alignments of satellites similar to that observed around the andromeda galaxy . \n we consider m31-like host galaxies in a range of a full decade in stellar mass around the m31 value and require that they reside in parent dark matter halos that are no more massive than plausible values for the local group .    by applying the pandas spatial selection function \n we derive views of planes of 15 satellites that are comparable to the observed configuration . \n we analyzed the perpendicular thinness , radial extent , coherent kinematics and angular momentum properties of the simulated samples together , and found cases similar to the observed planar structure to be extremely rare , occurring in only 0.030.04% of the samples . \n this shows that the observed alignment discovered by @xcite is surprising in @xmath0-cdm , if one assumes that the millennium - ii simulation has sufficient resolution to reliably detect counterparts of the observed satellites . \n nevertheless , the extreme rarity of analogs to the m31 system in the millennium - ii simulation does not necessarily preclude the possibility that planar structures may exist around different types of hosts in @xmath0-cdm simulations . by relaxing our search criteria that are specific to m31 , such as the adopted virial and baryonic mass constraints , and the requirement that there be no nearby large neighbor \n , the number of candidate systems increases from 679 to over 2000 for virial masses in the range @xmath46@xmath47 . \n while a thorough analysis of such simulated satellite systems is beyond the scope of the present paper , we believe that it will be of great importance to ascertain the incidence of satellite alignments in nature for galaxies beyond the local group .", "human_aspect": "{\n  \"background\": \"in a recent contribution, @xcite investigated the incidence of planar alignments of satellite galaxies in the millennium -

hoc or cellular networks @xcite . moreover , implementing nc , as an alternative method of routing , in which the nodes in the network process their received packets , can help to increase the multiplexing gain of such networks . \n a very simple example of a cooperative system is a multiple access relay channel ( marc ) . \n although there is no direct cooperation between the users , sharing the relay node can be seen as a cooperative behavior . \n a relay node can be utilized conventionally , where at each time slot the relay only serves for one of the users . on the other hand , \n if the relay can process the received data from the users and aggregate these data and then send the new aggregated data to the destination , it would be possible to achieve diversity . \n one instance of such doing can be found in @xcite , where an xoring scheme was considered as a simple way of implementing nc in a wireless network in order to provide diversity in the network . \n the authors in  @xcite have proposed a scheme in a marc in which the users send the log - likelihood ratio ( llr ) of their coded messages to the destination in a noisy channel , and they have shown that their proposed scheme improves the bit error probability ( bep ) of the system . \n practical analogue nc for cooperation in the physical - layer of marc has not been considered yet , and it has prompted us to consider this method of cooperative scheme here .    in this paper , we propose a cooperative scheme based on a simple addition of the received signals in the relay node . \n we loosely call this scheme as an instance of analogue nc . to this end \n , we consider a system which uses decode and forward ( df ) for relay cooperation , and after modulating the users re - encoded packets , simply adds the packets for transmission in the relay . \n we assume that each node has a single antenna . \n also we assume that each user has a power limitation of @xmath0 , but the power limitation of the relay node in @xmath1-user marc will be @xmath2 which is logical . \n we propose a detection method in the end - node , i.e. destination , being based on v - blast model in a multiple - antenna system  @xcite . \n we derive a tight upper bound on the system s bep for both uncoded and coded transmissions , from which we show that using v - blast detection technique , we can achieve full - order diversity , being two in a two - user marc setting . \n simulation results indicate that the bounds are tight enough . \n moreover , results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a diversity order of two for any number of users and only one relay node , in contrast to the traditional methods ( e.g. alamouti scheme ) in which each user must have two antennas for transmission . \n the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : \n systemdescription ] , we briefly describe the system and the proposed transmission protocol . in section  [ sec : detection ] \n we introduce the detection algorithm . \n the performance analysis is presented in section  [ sec : perfanal ] . \n numerical experiments are shown in section  [ sec : numexp ] . \n we finally finish the paper with the concluding remarks in section  [ sec : conc ] . \n notation and abbreviations in the paper are as below . \n boldface lower case letters denote column vectors . \n concatenation of several vectors is also denoted by a boldface lower case letter . \n @xmath3 element of the vector @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath5 . \n boldface upper case letters are used to denote matrices . \n @xmath6 denotes transpose operators . \n the cadinality of a set @xmath7 is shown by @xmath8 . \n @xmath9 denotes the probability of event @xmath10 when dealing with random variable , @xmath11 , we use @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 to denote the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) , probability density function ( pdf ) , and characteristic function , respectively . \n finally , the notation @xmath15 $ ] is used to denote taking expectation of @xmath16 with respect to the subscript @xmath11 . \n for the simplicity of presentation , we consider marc with two users a and b , and one relay r , and the destination d. the results can be generalized for more than two users sharing one relay . \n figure  [ fig : marc - view ] shows a two - user marc used throughly in this paper .        in what follows , we model the received signals at the destination and relay node . \n the transmitted signal by the relay node is considered in the next subsection . \n let @xmath17 denote the channel gain between nodes @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 . \n the channel gains are assumed to be independent zero mean complex gaussian random variables with the powers of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , for the link between the user ( @xmath24 or @xmath25 ) and the relay ( @xmath26 ) , and the link between node ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , or @xmath26 ) and the destination , respectively . \n that is , we have considered different qualities for user - relay and user ( relay)-destination channels . \n we assume a block fading in which the channel ( gain ) coefficient is constant during each block transmission @xcite . \n moreover , we assume that each user sends a codeword @xmath27 .    for all the wireless communication links shown in figure  [ fig : marc - view ] \n , we consider an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) with one - sided power spectral density ( psd ) of @xmath28 . \n then , knowing the fact that @xmath29 s are normally distributed with the powers mentioned above , the instantaneous signal to noise ratio ( snr ) of the link between user @xmath30 and the relay node @xmath26 is given by @xmath31 being distributed exponentially as follows    @xmath32    furthermore , the received signals at the destination from two users can be modeled as @xmath33 whereas @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the received additive ( vector - valued ) white gaussian noises at the destination side . \n the @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the vectors of dimension @xmath1 , denote the transmitted blocks from users @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , with the following power constraints : @xmath38 where @xmath1 is the number of bits in each block . \n similarly , the received signals at the relay node are given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the noises received at the relay node through user @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . \n since , in this paper we aim at proposing a cooperative protocol while sharing a single relay node by two nodes , we propose to divide the time as shown in figure  [ fig : timeslot ] . in figure  [ fig : timeslot ] the transmission time slots are allocated based on time division multiple access ( tdma ) scheme .        as illustrated in figure  [ fig : timeslot ] , in the first two time slots , users a and b transmit their blocks . \n then , the relay , based on its received signals @xmath42 and @xmath43 , decodes the received blocks . depending on whether or not the relay can correctly decode the received blocks , which can be recognized by a error - detecting code ( e.g. , crc codes ) , the relay decides upon cooperation with the two transmitters in the third slot , as shown in figure  [ fig : timeslot ] leading to four possible scenarios summarized in table  [ table : relayscenarios ] .    .four possible states at the relay node . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     as can be inferred from table  [ table : relayscenarios ] , relay cooperation can be categorized into four states : first , corresponding to @xmath44 , the relay will be silent , and as a result the destination only receives the direct block transmissions from two users . \n hence , the bit error probability is the same as that of a direct transmission with power @xmath45 . \n second , corresponding to @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the relay node only cooperates in transmission of one of the users . \n thereby , only one of the users benefits a second order diversity transmission . denoting this user by @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , \n the received signal at the destination from the relay will be @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are relay s estimate of user s signal and additive noise at the destination , respectively . in this case , the bit error probability for the assisted user is equal to that of a maximum ratio combining ( mrc ) receiver , @xcite , with two independent receptions of the transmitted signal , and for the other user , it is similar to the first state . \n lastly , for @xmath53 , the relay can successfully decode both users blocks . \n then , the relay encodes and modulates these signals separately , and transmits the sum of the modulated analog signals . \n thus , the destination node will receive the following signal @xmath54 \n in this section , we propose a method for detection at the destination node . \n first , we assume that the destination knows fading coefficients , e.g. by acquiring transmitting pilot symbols , and also knows the state of cooperation at the relay , e.g. it can be implemented by sending 2 bits encoding four states . for @xmath55 in table \n [ table : relayscenarios ] , both users have interference - free direct transmission , and , as stated above , the conventional receiver is used . for @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , the user which is able to utilize relay resource , the destination uses mrc of the two received signals , one from the user and the other from the relay . in the last state \n , we propose a novel method for detection relying on the basis of v - blast detection . \n first , from equations  - , we rewrite the three received signals in three time slots ( see figure  [ fig : timeslot ] ) at the destination in a following matrix format given by    @xmath58    without loss of generality , we focus on detecting user @xmath24 s block . doing so , we first define the vector conveying user @xmath25 s as follows @xmath59 the null space of @xmath60 , denoted by @xmath61 $ ] , can then be spanned by @xmath62    it should be noted that , the matrix @xmath63 defined in equation   is one of many possible null spaces for vector @xmath64 . now multiplying both sides of   by transposed of matrix @xmath63 , one may obtain @xmath65\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{a } }   + \\left [ \\begin{array}{c }   \\frac { { - h_{\\text{r , d } } } } { { \\sqrt { |h_{\\text{b , d } } |^2   + |h_{\\text{r , d } } |^2 } } } \\mathbf{n}_{\\text{b}}^d   + \\frac{{h_{\\text{b , d } } } } { { \\sqrt { |h_{\\text{b , d } } |^2   + |h_{\\text{r , d } } |^2 } } } \\mathbf{n}_{\\text{r}}^d   \\\\   \\mathbf{n}_{\\text{a}}^d \n \\\\   \\end{array } \\right]{\\rm {    } } \\ ] ]    as can be realized from equation  , we have two receptions for user @xmath24 s signal . \n owing to independency between @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , we have    @xmath69    now , if we use the mrc method for detection of @xmath37 , we obtain    @xmath70    a similar procedure can be employed for @xmath36 by multiplying two sides of equation   by another matrix representing the null space of the vector , conveying user @xmath24 s signal ( similar to that of user @xmath25 ) . \n then , the snrs at the outputs of mrc receivers can be written as @xmath71 computing these factors , the destination node chooses to decode the user with the maximum snr at first . \n let @xmath72 denote the user with the highest snr , i.e. @xmath73 for this user , the destination utilizes the mrc receiver . \n then , the effect of this user signal is subtracted from the received signal @xmath74 , i.e. @xmath75 then , conditioned on the detection of the user @xmath76 being error - free , for the second user ( denoted by @xmath77 ) a diversity order of two can be achieved , with the following snr @xmath78    denoting the set of all users sharing a relay node in a marc by @xmath79 , the snr of the user to be decoded ( at the destination ) first is given by @xmath80\\frac{p}{n_0}\\ ] ]    after decoding the first user s signal , its effect will be subtracted from @xmath81 \n . then , the next best user is found , similar to equation   except the fact that , now we have one user less the initial case . \n a detailed description of the proposed detection algorithm is illustrated in algorithm  [ alg : detection ] . \n [ alg : detection ] \n in this section , we evaluate the performance of the proposed receiver . \n we assume that the user - relay channel ( urc ) is stronger than both the user- and relay - destination channels ( that is @xmath82 ) . \n we also assume that whenever the relay cooperates , it cooperates correctly . \n this assumption sounds , since if a strong crc ( cyclic redundancy check ) code is used , the relay can can detect all users signals . \n hence , if the relay detects an error in its received codeword , it discards the whole block and does not cooperate . in the following , \n we assume a bpsk modulation . \n for the bep evaluation , we first compute the probabilities of each state summarized in table  [ table : relayscenarios ] as follows @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are the probabilities that the relay can not correctly decode user a ( b ) transmitted block . \n these probabilities can be assumed to be negligible at high snrs . in this section \n , we derive the bep for an uncoded transmission , and then we generalize our result to a convolutionally coded transmission , in which the user s data are first convolutionally coded and then the coded block is transmitted .    here \n we derive the bep for user @xmath86 in the illustration in figure  [ fig : marc - view ] . due to the symmetry in the structure \n , it will be the same for user b. we state the main result for the non - coded scheme in the following theorem :    [ thm : result1 ] let us denote the bep for user @xmath86 in a marc by @xmath87 . \n moreover , assume that the relay cooperation is error - free . \n then , for i.i.d . \n rayleigh block fading channels between users ( and relay ) to destination with parameter @xmath88 we have @xmath89 + \\frac{p_3}{4}\\big[(\\frac{\\omega_{\\rightarrow \\text{d }

snrs ( large values of @xmath100 or @xmath101 ) , as @xmath102 , we have @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 are some positive constants , and @xmath107 means @xmath108 .    thus , since at large snrs , @xmath109 and @xmath110 will be negligible compared to @xmath111 the dominant terms will be the second and third terms which decrease inversely with squared snr . as a result , with the definition of the diversity order , the proposed scheme can achieve second order of diversity . \n in this section , we present some numerical results to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme . \n we set @xmath112 and change @xmath113 to consider various link qualities ( it will be discussed later ) . \n first we investigate the uncoded scheme . \n figure  [ fig : simul1 ] shows the plots of bep versus snr per bit for direct transmission , alamouti scheme using 2 transmitting antennas , and our proposed scheme . for our scheme , the plot based on the analytical result of theorem 1 has been included as well . in this plots \n , we have assumed ideal user and relay channel ( urc ) . that is users to relay links are error free . \n as we expect , for the proposed scheme , the simulation result coincides with the bound of theorem 1 at high snr , and the slope of the plot is the same as that of the alamouti scheme which indicates that the proposed scheme achieves second order of diversity . \n for the rest of the comparisons , we consider coded schemes in which we assume that users and relay use the same convolutional code for transmission where each block consists of 50 information bits , i.e. , @xmath114 . \n we assume that the users a and b apply crc to their transmitted block in order the relay to be able to detect its decoders errors , also a convolutional code with @xmath115 and @xmath116 which its octal coefficients are @xmath117 } } } $ ] is considered for the coded transmission . \n first , we show that the upper bound derived in theorem 2 is tight enough . \n figure  [ fig : simul2 ] shows the performance of our proposed scheme based on both simulation and analytical results in the presence of ideal urc .            for comparison , \n the performance of direct transmission ( without the relay cooperation ) and the alamouti scheme(for two transmit antennas ) are provided . \n we consider equal total transmission powers for comparison . \n it means that the total power of the user and relay transmissions is the same as the power used in direct and alamouti transmissions . \n as can be realized , the derived upper bound is tight enough . \n furthermore , the proposed scheme substantially outperforms the direct transmission . \n figure  [ fig : simul3 ] shows the plots of ber versus snr per bit for our proposed marc scheme with different urc s qualities based on both simulations and the upper bound derived in theorem 2 .        in this plot , for instance the notion `` @xmath118 urc '' , indicates that the qualities of the sources a and b to the relay links are 3db better than the sources to the destination links . from this figure , \n the upper bound becomes looser when the quality of urc decreases . \n however , it must be noted that the slope of the plot does not change with the urc s qualities .    in figure \n [ fig : simul4 ] 6 , we compare the performance of our proposed scheme for different qualities of urc with alamouti scheme and direct transmission ( without relay ) for the same transmitted powers , based on simulation results . \n as can be generalized , the slope of ber plots for our scheme for different urc s qualities are the same as the alamouti scheme which indicates a diversity of order two , as expected from our theoretical derivations .        in our further evaluation , \n we have also considered a marc system with three users . \n we have assumed a ideal urc . \n 7 shows the plots of ber versus snr per bit for marc with 2 and 3 users . the plots for the alamouti s scheme and no relay cooperation scheme are included for comparisons . \n as can be realized again , with only one relay , the marc with 3 users achieves second order of diversity . \n it must be noted that our scheme for 3 users , by 4 antennas can achieve second order of diversity for all users in contrast of the traditional schemes in which 6 antennas are required for the same number of users to achieve the diversity order of 2 . \n we have introduced a novel scheme for marc , which utilizes the network coding in an analogue space . using the nulling detection structure applied in v - blast \n , destination can extract the users signals from two independent received paths . \n we have evaluated the performance of the proposed receiver and provided a tight upper bound for its bit error probability . \n our analysis for i.i.d . \n block rayleigh fading channels have indicated that the proposed scheme can achieve a diversity order of two . \n we have also provided a tight upper bound of bit error rate for the coded transmission in which the users and relay use the same convolutional code . as have shown for @xmath119 our proposed scheme \n can be generalized for a marc with more than two users and only one relay , in which all users benefit a diversity order of two , in contrast to the traditional non - cooperated schemes in which @xmath120 antennas are required for the same order of diversity , where @xmath1 is the number of users . \n in what follows , without loss of generality , we find the bep for user a. then , considering the @xmath121th bit of user a s codeword , the bep may be expressed using the conditional bit error probabilities as follows @xmath122 = \\text{e}\\big[\\sum\\limits_{i = 0}^3 { \\pr ( \\hat x_{\\text{a},j }   \\ne x_{\\text{a},j } |s_i ) } \\pr ( s_i ) \\big],\\ ] ] in which @xmath123 stands for the rely s state , are defined in tabel  [ table : relayscenarios ] and the expectation is taken on channel gains . as we mentioned in previous section , bit error probabilities of the system conditioned on @xmath124 and @xmath125 \n are the same for user a , therefore we have @xmath126.\\ ] ] then , for @xmath127 , as there exists also relay transmission , we have    @xmath128 , depending on whether or not the user with the highest received snr at the mrc receiver s output ( @xmath129 defined in equation  , or @xmath130 defined in equation  ) , is user a , we will have different values for bep . \n because of the symmetrical structure of the scheme we have @xmath131 as a result , we simply obtain @xmath132 where from equations   and , we have @xmath133 now , we compute equations . plugging @xmath134 in equations , , and , and taking the expectation \n , we obtain    ( x_,j & & x_,j |s_0 ) = ( x_,j x_,j

@xmath143 then , since @xmath138 and @xmath144 are exponentially distributed with parameter @xmath145 , their characteristic functions are given by @xmath146 for deriving the characteristic function of @xmath142 we need to know its pdf , so we propound the following lemma . \n [ lem : probability - lemma ] suppose that @xmath48 and @xmath147 are two independent exponentially - distributed random

access data have been considered in the literature . among these , \n two of the most prominent are via _ membership queries _ and via _ \n random examples_. membership queries are `` black - box '' queries ; in a membership query , a learning algorithm submits an input @xmath9 to an oracle and receives the value of @xmath10 . in models of learning from random examples , each time the learning algorithm queries the oracle it receives a labeled example @xmath11 where @xmath9 is independently drawn from some fixed probability distribution over the space of all possible examples . \n ( we give precise definitions of these , and all the learning models we consider , in section  [ sec : jprelim ] . )    in recent years a number of researchers have considered quantum variants of well - studied models in computational learning theory , see e.g. @xcite . as we describe in section  [ \n sec : jprelim ] , models of learning from quantum membership queries and from fixed quantum superpositions of labeled examples ( we refer to these as _ quantum examples _ ) have been considered ; such oracles have been studied in the context of _ quantum property testing _ as well @xcite . \n one common theme in the existing literature on quantum computational learning and testing is that these works study algorithms whose only access to the function is via some form of quantum oracle such as the quantum membership oracle or quantum example oracles mentioned above . for instance \n , @xcite modifies the classical harmonic sieve algorithm of @xcite so that it uses only uniform quantum examples to learn @xmath12 formulas . \n @xcite considers the problem of quantum property testing using quantum membership queries to give an exponential separation between classical and quantum testers for certain concept classes . \n @xcite studies the information - theoretic requirements of exact learning using quantum membership queries and probably approximately correct ( pac ) learning using quantum examples . \n many other articles such as @xcite could further extend this list .    as the problem of building large scale quantum computers remains a major challenge , \n it is natural to question the technical feasibility of large scale implementation of the quantum oracles considered in the literature . \n it is desirable to minimize the number of quantum ( as opposed to classical ) oracle queries or examples required by quantum algorithms . \n thus motivated , in this paper we are interested in designing testing and learning algorithms with access to both quantum and classical sources of information ( with the goal of minimizing the quantum resources required ) . \n all of our positive results are based on a quantum subroutine due to @xcite , which we will refer to as an @xmath2 ( fourier sample ) oracle call . \n as explained in section  [ sec : jprelim ] , a call to the @xmath2 oracle yields a subset of @xmath13 ( this set should be viewed as a subset of the input variables @xmath14 of @xmath3 ) drawn according to the fourier spectrum of the boolean function @xmath3 . as demonstrated by @xcite , such an oracle \n can be implemented using @xmath15 uniform quantum examples from a uniform distribution quantum example oracle . \n in fact , all of our algorithms will be purely classical apart from their use of the @xmath2 oracle . \n thus , all of our algorithms can be implemented within the ( uniform distribution ) quantum pac model first proposed by @xcite . \n this model is a natural quantum extension of the classical pac model introduced by valiant @xcite , as described in section  [ sec : jprelim ] . \n we emphasize that no membership queries , classical or quantum , are used in our algorithms , only uniform quantum superpositions of labeled examples , and we recall that such uniform quantum examples can not efficiently simulate even classical membership queries in general ( see @xcite ) . \n our approach of focusing only on the @xmath2 oracle allows us to abstract away from the intricacies of quantum computation , and renders our results useful in any setting in which an @xmath2 oracle can be provided to the user . \n in fact , learning and testing with @xmath2 oracle queries may be regarded as a new distinct model ( which may possibly be weaker than the uniform distribution quantum example model ) . \n we are primarily interested in the information theoretic requirements ( i.e. the number of oracle calls needed ) of the learning and testing problems that we discuss . \n we give upper and lower bounds for a range of learning and testing problems related to _ \n @xmath0-juntas _ ; these are boolean functions @xmath16 that depend only on ( an unknown subset of ) at most @xmath0 of the @xmath1 input variables @xmath14 . \n juntas have been the subject of intensive research in learning theory and property testing in recent years , see e.g.  @xcite . \n our first result , in section  [ sec : testjuntas ] , is a @xmath0-junta testing algorithm which uses @xmath17 @xmath2 oracle calls . \n our algorithm uses fewer queries than the best known classical junta testing algorithm due to fischer _ \n @xcite , which uses @xmath18 membership queries . however , since the best lower bound known for classical membership query based junta testing ( due to chockler and gutfreund @xcite ) is @xmath19 , our result does not rule out the possibility that there might exist a classical membership query algorithm with the same query complexity .    to complement our @xmath2 based testing algorithm , we establish a new lower bound : any @xmath0-junta testing algorithm that uses only a @xmath2 oracle requires @xmath6 calls to the @xmath2 oracle \n this shows that our testing algorithm is not too far from optimal . \n finally , we consider algorithms that can both make @xmath2 queries and also access classical random examples . in section  [ sec : learnjuntas ] we give an algorithm for learning @xmath0-juntas over @xmath20 that uses @xmath7 @xmath2 queries and @xmath21 random examples . since any classical learning algorithm requires @xmath22 examples ( even if it is allowed to use membership queries ) \n , this result illustrates that it is possible to reduce the classical query complexity substantially ( in particular , to eliminate the dependence on @xmath1 ) if the learning algorithm is also permitted to have some very limited quantum information . \n moreover most of the consumption of our algorithm is from classical random examples which are considered quite `` cheap '' relative to quantum examples . from another perspective \n , our result shows that for learning @xmath0-juntas , almost all the quantum examples used by the algorithm of bshouty and jackson @xcite can in fact be converted into ordinary classical random examples . \n we show that our algorithm is close to best possible by giving a nearly matching lower bound .      in section  [ sec : jprelim ] \n we describe the models and problems we will consider and present some useful preliminaries from fourier analysis and probability . \n section  [ sec : testjuntas ] gives our results on testing juntas and section  [ sec : learnjuntas ] gives our results on learning juntas . \n in keeping with standard terminology in learning theory , a _ concept _ @xmath3 over @xmath23 is a boolean function @xmath24 , where @xmath25 stands for true and @xmath26 stands for false . \n concept class _ @xmath27 is a set of concepts where @xmath28 consists of those concepts in @xmath29 whose domain is @xmath30 for ease of notation throughout the paper we will omit the subscript in @xmath28 and simply write @xmath31 to denote a collection of concepts over @xmath20 . \n the concept class we will chiefly be interested in is the class of _ @xmath0-juntas_. \n a boolean function @xmath32 is a @xmath0-junta if @xmath3 depends only on @xmath0 out of its @xmath1 input variables . \n we are interested in the following computational problems :    pac learning under the uniform distribution : : :    given any _ \n target concept _ @xmath33 , an    _ @xmath34-learning algorithm for concept class    @xmath31 _ under the uniform distribution outputs a _ hypothesis _ \n function @xmath35 which ,    with probability at least @xmath36 , agrees with    @xmath37 on at least a @xmath38 fraction of the    inputs in @xmath30 this is a widely studied    framework in the learning theory literature both in classical ( see for    instance @xcite ) and in quantum ( see @xcite ) versions . \n property testing : : :    let @xmath3 be any boolean function @xmath39 . \n a _ property testing    algorithm for concept class @xmath31 _ is an algorithm which ,    given access to @xmath3 , behaves as follows :    +    * if @xmath33 then the algorithm outputs accept with    probability at least @xmath36 ;    * if @xmath3 is _ @xmath34-far _ from any concept    in @xmath31 ( i.e. for every concept @xmath40 ,    @xmath3 and @xmath41 differ on at least an    @xmath34 fraction of all inputs ) , then the algorithm    outputs reject with probability at least @xmath36 . \n +    the notion of property testing was first developed by @xcite and    @xcite . \n quantum property testing was first studied by buhrman _ \n et    al . _ \n @xcite , who first gave an example of an exponential separation    between the query complexity of classical and quantum testers for a    particular concept class .    note that a learning or testing algorithm for @xmath31 `` knows '' the class @xmath31 but does not know the identity of the concept @xmath3 . \n while our primary concern is the number of oracle calls that our algorithms use , we are also interested in _ time efficient _ algorithms for testing and learning ; for the concept class of @xmath0-juntas , these are algorithms running in poly@xmath42 time steps .      in order for learning and testing algorithms to gather information about the unknown concept @xmath3 \n , they need an information source called an _ \n oracle_. the number of times an oracle is queried by an algorithm is referred to as the _ query complexity_. sometimes our algorithms will be allowed access to more than one type of oracle in our discussion .    in this paper we will consider the following types of oracles that provide classical information :    membership oracle @xmath43 : : :    for @xmath3 a boolean function , a _ membership oracle _ \n @xmath44 is an oracle which , when queried with    input @xmath9 , outputs the label @xmath10 assigned    by @xmath3 to @xmath45 uniform random example oracle @xmath46 : : :    a query @xmath47 of the random example oracle    returns an ordered pair @xmath48 where @xmath9    is drawn uniformly random from the set @xmath49 of all    possible inputs . \n clearly a single call to an @xmath43 oracle can simulate the random example oracle @xmath46 . \n indeed @xmath46 oracle queries are considered `` cheap '' compared to membership queries . \n for example , in many settings it is possible to obtain random labeled examples but impossible to obtained the label of a particular desired example ( consider prediction problems dealing with phenomena such as weather or financial markets ) . \n we note that the set of concept classes that are known to be efficiently pac learnable from uniform random examples only is rather limited , see e.g. @xcite . \n in contrast , there are known efficient algorithms that use membership queries to learning important function classes such as @xmath12 ( disjunctive normal form ) formulas @xcite . \n we will consider the following quantum oracles , which are the natural quantum generalizations of membership queries and uniform random examples respectively . \n quantum membership oracle @xmath50 : : :    the quantum membership oracle @xmath51 is the    quantum oracle whose query acts on the computational basis states as    follows :    @xmath52 uniform quantum examples @xmath53 : : :    the uniform quantum example oracle @xmath54 is    the quantum oracle whose query acts on the computational basis state    @xmath55 as follows :    @xmath56 the action of a    @xmath54 query is undefined on other basis    states , and an algorithm may only invoke the    @xmath54 query on the basis state    @xmath57 . \n it is clear that a @xmath50 oracle can simulate a @xmath53 oracle or an @xmath43 oracle , and a @xmath53 oracle can simulate an @xmath46 oracle . \n the model of pac learning with a uniform quantum example oracle was introduced by bshouty and jackson in @xcite . \n several researchers have also studied learning from a more powerful @xmath51 oracle , see e.g.  @xcite . turning to property testing , \n we are not aware of prior work on quantum testing using only the @xmath54 oracle ; instead researchers have considered quantum testing algorithms that use the more powerful @xmath51 oracle , see e.g.  @xcite . \n we will make use of the fourier expansion of real valued functions over @xmath23 . \n we write @xmath58 $ ] to denote the set of variables @xmath59 . \n consider the set of real valued functions over @xmath23 endowed with the inner product @xmath60 = { \\frac 1 { 2^n } } \\sum_x f(x ) g(x)\\ ] ] and induced norm @xmath61 . \n for each @xmath62 $ ] , let @xmath63 be the parity function @xmath64 it is a well known fact that the @xmath65 functions @xmath66\\}$ ] form an orthonormal basis for the vector space of real valued functions over @xmath23 with the above inner product . \n consequently , every @xmath67 can be expressed uniquely as : @xmath68 }   { \\hat{f}(s)}\\chi_s(x)\\ ] ] which we refer to as the _ fourier expansion _ or _ fourier transform _ of @xmath3 . \n alternatively , the values @xmath69 \\ } $ ] are called the _ fourier coefficients _ or the _ fourier spectrum _ of @xmath3 . \n _ parseval s identity _ , which is an easy consequence of orthonormality of the basis functions , relates the values of the coefficients to the values of the function :    [ bparseval ] for any @xmath67 , we have @xmath70 } |{\\hat{f}(s)}|^2= { { \\bf e}}[f^2]$ ] . \n thus for a boolean valued function @xmath70 } |{\\hat{f}(s)}|^2=1 $ ] . \n we will use the following simple and well - known fact :    [ kmfact ] for any @xmath32 and any @xmath71 , we have @xmath72\\leq{{\\bf e}}_{x}[{(f(x)-g(x))}^{2}]=\\sum_{s\\subseteq[n]}|{\\hat{f}(s)}-\\hat{g}(s)|^{2}\\ ] ]    recall that the _ influence _ of a variable @xmath73 on a boolean function @xmath3 is the probability ( taken over a uniform random input @xmath9 for @xmath3 ) that @xmath3 changes its value when the @xmath74-th bit of @xmath9 is flipped , i.e. @xmath75.\\ ] ] it is well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that @xmath76      [ dpi]let @xmath77 be two random variables over the same domain . \n for any ( possibly randomized ) algorithm @xmath78 , one has that @xmath79    let @xmath80 be random variables corresponding to sequences of draws taken from two different distributions over the same domain . by the above inequality , \n if @xmath81 is known to be small , then the probability of success must be small for any algorithm designed to distinguish if the draws are made according to @xmath82 or @xmath83 \n .    we will also use standard chernoff bounds on tails of sums of independent random variables :    let @xmath84 be i.i.d . \n random variables with mean @xmath85 taking values in the range @xmath86 $ ] . \n then for all @xmath87 we have @xmath88\\leq 2 \\exp(\\frac{-2\\lambda^2 m}{(b - a)^2})$ ] . \n let @xmath89 be a boolean function . \n the _ fourier sampling oracle _ \n @xmath90 is the classical oracle which , at each invocation , returns each subset of variables @xmath91 with probability @xmath92 , where @xmath93 denotes the fourier coefficient corresponding to @xmath94 as defined in section  [ sec : bfour ] \n .    this oracle will play an important role in our algorithms . \n note that by parseval s identity we have @xmath95 }    @xmath96 indeed has total weight 1 .    in @xcite \n bshouty and jackson describe a simple constant - size quantum network ` qsamp ` , which has its roots in an idea from @xcite . ` qsamp ` allows sampling from the fourier spectrum of a boolean function using @xmath15 @xmath53 oracle queries :    [ bjfact ] for any boolean function @xmath3 , it is possible to simulate a draw from the @xmath90 oracle with probability @xmath97 using @xmath98 queries to @xmath54 . \n all the algorithms we describe are actually classical algorithms that make @xmath2 queries . \n fischer _ et al . _ \n @xcite studied the problem of testing juntas given black - box access ( i.e. , classical membership query access ) to the unknown function @xmath3 using harmonic analysis and probabilistic methods . \n they gave several different algorithms with query complexity independent of @xmath1 , the most efficient of which yields the following :    [ s1thm1]there is an algorithm that tests whether an unknown @xmath89 is a @xmath0-junta using @xmath18 membership queries . \n fischer _ et al . \n _ also gave a lower bound on the number of queries required for testing juntas , which was subsequently improved by chockler _ \n _ to the following :    [ s1thm2 ] any algorithm that tests whether @xmath3 is a @xmath0-junta or is @xmath99-far from every @xmath0-junta must use @xmath19 membership queries . \n we emphasize that that both of these results concern algorithms with classical membership query access .      in this section \n we describe a new testing algorithm that uses the @xmath2 oracle and prove the following theorem about its performance :    [ s1qthm1]there is an algorithm that tests the property of being a @xmath0-junta using @xmath5 calls to the @xmath2 oracle .    as described in section  [ sec : jprelim ] , the algorithm can thus be implemented using @xmath100 uniform quantum examples from @xmath54 . \n consider the following algorithm @xmath101 which has @xmath2 oracle access to an unknown function @xmath32 . \n algorithm @xmath101 first makes @xmath102 calls to the @xmath2 oracle ; let @xmath103 denote the union of all the sets of variables received as responses to these oracle calls . \n algorithm @xmath101 then outputs `` accept '' if @xmath104 and outputs `` reject '' if @xmath105 . \n it is clear that if @xmath3 is a @xmath0-junta then @xmath101 outputs `` accept '' with probability 1 . to prove correctness of the test it suffices to show that if @xmath3 is @xmath4-far from any @xmath0-junta then @xmath106 outputs `` reject''@xmath107 \\geq { \\frac 2 3}.$ ]    the argument is similar to the standard analysis of the coupon collector s problem \n let us view the set @xmath103 as growing incrementally step by step as successive calls to the @xmath2 oracle are performed . \n let @xmath108 be a random variable which denotes the number of @xmath2 queries that take place starting immediately after the @xmath109-st new variable is added to @xmath103 , up through the draw when the @xmath74-th new variable is added to @xmath103 . if the @xmath109-st and @xmath74-th new variables are obtained in the same draw then @xmath110 . \n ( for example , if the first three queries to the @xmath2 oracle are @xmath111 @xmath112 , @xmath113 , then we would have @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 . )    since @xmath3 is @xmath4-far from any @xmath0-junta , we know that for any set @xmath119 of @xmath120 variables , it must be the case that @xmath121 ( since otherwise if we set @xmath122 and use fact  [ kmfact ] , we would have @xmath123\\leq{{\\bf e}}_{x}[{(f(x)-g(x))}^{2 } ] = \\sum_{s \\not\\subseteq \\mathcal{t } } \\hat{f}(s)^2 < \\epsilon\\ ] ] which contradicts the fact that @xmath3 is @xmath4-far from any @xmath0-junta ) . \n it follows that for each @xmath124 , if at the current stage of the construction of @xmath103 we have @xmath125 , then the probability that the next @xmath2 query yields a new variable outside of @xmath103 is at least @xmath4 . \n consequently we have @xmath126 \\leq { \\frac 1 { \\epsilon}}$ ] for each @xmath127 , and hence @xmath128 \\leq { \\frac { ( k+1 ) } { \\epsilon}}.\\ ] ] by markov s inequality , the probability that @xmath129 is at least @xmath130 , and therefore with probability at least @xmath130 it will be the case after @xmath102 draws that @xmath105 and the algorithm will consequently output `` reject . '' \n note that the @xmath100 uniform quantum examples required for algorithm @xmath101 improves on the @xmath131 query complexity of the best known classical algorithm . \n however our result does not conclusively show that @xmath53 queries are more powerful than classical membership queries for this problem since it is conceivable that there could exist an as yet undiscovered @xmath100 classical membership query algorithm .        as a first attempt to obtain a lower bound on the number of @xmath2 oracle calls required to test @xmath0-juntas \n , it is natural to consider the approach of chockler _ et al . _ from @xcite . to prove theorem  [ s1thm2 ] , chockler _ et al . _ \n show that any classical algorithm which can successfully distinguish between the following two probability distributions over black - box functions must use @xmath19 queries :    * * scenario i : * the distribution @xmath132 is uniform over the set of all boolean functions over @xmath1 variables which do not depend on variables @xmath133 * * scenario ii : * the distribution @xmath134 is defined as follows : to draw a function @xmath3 from this distribution , first an index @xmath74 is chosen uniformly from @xmath135 , and then @xmath3 is chosen uniformly from among those functions that do not depend on variables @xmath136 or on variable @xmath74 . \n the following observation shows that this approach will not yield a strong lower bound for algorithms that have access to a @xmath2 oracle :    with @xmath137 queries to a @xmath2 oracle , it is possible to determine w.h.p . whether a function @xmath3 is drawn from scenario i or scenario ii . \n it is easy to see that a function drawn from scenario i is simply a random function on the first @xmath138 variables . \n the fourier spectrum of random boolean functions is studied in @xcite , where it is shown that sums of squares of fourier coefficients of random boolean functions are tightly concentrated around their expected value . in particular , proposition  6 of @xcite directly implies that for any fixed variable @xmath139 we have : @xmath140 < \\exp(-2^{k+1}/2592).\\ ] ] thus with overwhelmingly high probability , if @xmath3 is drawn from scenario i then each @xmath2 query will `` expose '' variable @xmath74 with probability at least @xmath99 . \n it follows that after @xmath137 queries all @xmath138 variables will have been exposed ; so by making @xmath137 @xmath2 queries and simply checking whether or not @xmath138 variables have been exposed , one can determine w.h.p . \n whether @xmath3 is drawn from scenario i or scenario ii .    thus we must adopt a more sophisticated approach to prove a strong lower bound on @xmath2 oracle algorithms . \n our main result in this section is the following theorem :    [ s1qthm2 ] any algorithm that has @xmath2 oracle access to an unknown @xmath3 must use @xmath6 oracle calls to test whether @xmath3 is a @xmath0-junta . \n let @xmath0 be such that @xmath141 for some positive integer @xmath142 we let @xmath143 denote @xmath144 the _ addressing function _ on @xmath145 variables has @xmath146 `` addressing variables , '' which we shall denote @xmath147 and @xmath148 `` addressee variables '' which we denote @xmath149 the output of the function is the value of variable @xmath150 where the `` address '' @xmath151 is the element of @xmath152 whose binary representation is given by @xmath153 . \n figure  1 depicts a decision tree that computes the addressing function in the case @xmath154 . \n formally , the addressing function @xmath155 is defined as follows : @xmath156    [ fig : tree ] [ @xmath157[@xmath158 [ @xmath159 [ @xmath160 [ @xmath161 ] [ @xmath159 [ @xmath162 [ @xmath163 ] ] [ @xmath158 [ @xmath159 [ @xmath164 [ @xmath165 ] [ @xmath159 [ @xmath166 ] [ @xmath167 ] ] ]    intuitively , the addressing function will be useful for us because as we will see the fourier spectrum is `` spread out '' over the @xmath143 addressee variables ; this will make it difficult to distinguish the addressing function ( which is not a @xmath0-junta since @xmath168 and as we shall see is in fact far from every @xmath0-junta ) from a variant which is a @xmath0-junta . \n let @xmath169 be the @xmath1 variables that our boolean functions are defined over . \n we now define two distributions @xmath170 , @xmath171 over functions on these variables .    the distribution @xmath170 is defined as follows : to make a draw from @xmath170 ,    1 . \n first uniformly choose a subset @xmath172 of @xmath143 variables from @xmath173 ; 2 . \n next , replace the variables @xmath174 in the function @xmath175 with the variables in @xmath172 ( choosing the variables from @xmath172 in a uniformly random order ) . \n return the resulting function .    note that step ( 2 ) in the description of making a draw from @xmath170 above corresponds to placing the variables in @xmath172 uniformly at the leaves of the decision tree for @xmath176 ( see figure  1 ) . \n equivalently , if we write @xmath177 to denote the following function _ over @xmath1 variables _ @xmath178 a draw from @xmath170 is a function chosen uniformly at random from the set @xmath179 where @xmath180 ranges over all permutations of @xmath181    it is clear that every function in @xmath182 ( the support of @xmath170 ) depends on @xmath145 variables and thus is not a @xmath0-junta . \n in fact , every function in @xmath182 is far from being a @xmath0-junta :    every @xmath3 that has nonzero probability under @xmath170 is @xmath183-far from any @xmath0-junta . \n fix any such @xmath3 and let @xmath41 be any @xmath0-junta . \n it is clear that at least @xmath184 of the `` addressee '' variables of @xmath3 are not relevant variables for @xmath41 . for a @xmath185 fraction of all inputs to @xmath3 , \n the value of @xmath3 is determined by one of these addressee variables ; on such inputs the error rate of @xmath41 relative to @xmath3 will be precisely @xmath186    fix any function @xmath177 in @xmath182 . \n we now give an expression for the fourier representation of @xmath177 . \n the expression is obtained by viewing @xmath177 as a sum of @xmath143 subfunctions , one for each leaf of the decision tree , where each subfunction takes the appropriate nonzero value on inputs which reach the corresponding leaf and takes value 0 on all other inputs : @xmath187 @xmath188 note that whenever @xmath189 , the sum on the rhs of equation   has precisely one non - zero term which is @xmath190 . \n this is because the rest of the terms are annihilated since in each of these terms there is some index @xmath191 such that @xmath192 which makes @xmath193 . \n consequently this sum gives rise to exactly the addressing function in equation   which is defined as @xmath194 and consequently the equality in equation   follows . \n equation   follows easily from rearranging  . \n now we turn to @xmath195    the distribution @xmath171 is defined as follows : to make a draw from @xmath171 ,    1 . \n first uniformly choose a subset @xmath172 of @xmath196 variables from @xmath173 ; 2 . \n next , replace the variables @xmath197 in the function @xmath175 with the variables in @xmath172 ( choosing the variables from @xmath172 in a uniformly random order ) . \n 3 .   finally , \n for each @xmath198 do the following : if variable @xmath199 was used to replace variable @xmath200 in the previous step , let @xmath201 be a fresh uniform random @xmath202 value and replace variable @xmath203 with @xmath204 . \n return the resulting function . \n observe that for any integer @xmath205 with binary expansion @xmath206 , we have that the binary expansion of @xmath207 is @xmath208 . thus steps ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) in the description of making a draw from @xmath171 may be restated as follows in terms of the decision tree representation for @xmath176 :    * place the variables @xmath209 randomly among the leaves of the decision tree with index less than @xmath196 . * for each variable @xmath209 placed at the leaf with index @xmath210 above , throw a @xmath202 valued coin @xmath201 and place @xmath211 at the antipodal leaf location with index : @xmath212 . \n equivalently , if we write @xmath213 to denote the following function _ over @xmath1 variables _ @xmath214 a draw from @xmath171 is a function chosen uniformly at random from the set @xmath215 where @xmath180 ranges over all permutations of @xmath216 and @xmath217 ranges over all of @xmath218 . \n it is clear that every function in @xmath219 depends on at most @xmath220 variables , and thus is indeed a @xmath0-junta .    by considering the contribution to the fourier spectrum from each pair of leaves @xmath221 of the decision tree \n , we obtain the following expression for the fourier expansion of each function in the support of @xmath171 : @xmath222 @xmath223}\\quad = \\frac{1}{2^{r-1}}\\sum_{\\mathbf{i}=0}^{r/2 - 1}\\begin{cases}\\displaystyle      \\sum_{x\\subseteq\\{x_1,\\ldots , x_r\\ } , |x|\\ \\text{even } } ( -1)^{(\\sum_{x_{j}\\in x } i_{j } ) } y_{\\tau(\\mathbf{i } ) } \\chi_{x } & \\text{if $ s_{\\mathbf{i}}=1$;}\\\\       \\displaystyle \\sum_{x\\subseteq\\{x_1,\\ldots , x_r\\ } , |x|\\ \\text{odd } }   ( -1)^{(\\sum _ { x_{j}\\in x } i_{j } ) } y_{\\tau(\\mathbf{i } ) } \\chi_{x } & \\text{if $ s_{\\mathbf{i}}=-1$.}\\\\ \\end{cases}\\ ] ] just as in the equation  , whenever @xmath224 , the sum on the rhs of equation   has precisely one non - zero term which is @xmath190 if @xmath225 and @xmath226 if @xmath227 . \n therefore this sum gives rise to exactly the addressing function in equation   which is defined as @xmath213 and consequently the equality in equation   follows . \n it follows that for each @xmath228 in the support of @xmath171 and for any fixed @xmath199 , all elements of the set @xmath229 will have the same parity . \n moreover , when draws from @xmath171 are considered , for every distinct @xmath199 this odd / even parity is independent and uniformly random \n .    now we are ready to prove theorem  [ s1qthm2 ] . \n recall that a @xmath2 oracle query returns @xmath96 with probability @xmath230 for every subset @xmath96 of input variables to the function . considering the equations and , for any @xmath3 in @xmath219 or @xmath182 its @xmath2 oracle will return a pair of the form @xmath231 . \n let us define a set @xmath232 of `` typical '' outcomes from @xmath2 oracle queries . \n fix any @xmath233 , and let @xmath232 denote the set of all sequences @xmath234 of length @xmath235 which have the property that _ no @xmath236 occurs more than once among @xmath237_.    note that for any fixed @xmath238 , every non - zero fourier coefficient @xmath239 satisfies @xmath240 due to equation  . \n therefore after @xmath194 is drawn , for any fixed @xmath199 the probability of receiving a response of the form @xmath241 as the outcome of a @xmath2 query is either    @xmath242 , : :    if @xmath194 is not a function of @xmath199 , i.e.    @xmath243 ; or @xmath244 , : :    if @xmath245 . \n this is because    each of the @xmath246 responses @xmath241    occurs with probability @xmath247 . \n similarly , for any fixed @xmath248 , every non - zero fourier coefficient @xmath249 satisfies @xmath250 due to equation  . \n therefore after @xmath228 is drawn , for any fixed @xmath199 the probability of receiving a response of the form @xmath241 as the outcome of a @xmath2 query is either    @xmath242 , : :    if @xmath228 is not a function of    @xmath199 , i.e.    @xmath251 ; or @xmath252 , : :    if @xmath253 . \n this is because    each of the @xmath254 responses @xmath241    occurs with probability @xmath255 . \n now let us consider the probability of obtaining a sequence from @xmath232 under each scenario .    * \n if the function is drawn from @xmath170 : the probability is at least @xmath256}.\\ ] ] * if the function is from @xmath171 : the probability is at least @xmath257}\\ ] ]    now the crucial observation is that whether the function is drawn from @xmath170 or from @xmath171 , each sequence in @xmath232 is equiprobable by symmetry in the construction . to see this , simply consider the probability of receiving a fixed @xmath258 for some new @xmath259 in the next @xmath2 query of an unknown function drawn from either one of these distributions . using the above calculations for @xmath260 \n , one can directly calculate that these probabilities are equal in either scenario . \n alternatively , for a function drawn from @xmath171 one can observe that since each successive @xmath259 is `` new '' , a fresh random bit determines whether the support is an @xmath258 with @xmath261 odd or even ; once this is determined , the choice of @xmath262 is uniform from all subsets with the correct parity . \n thus the overall draw of @xmath241 is uniform over all @xmath262 s . \n considering that the subset of relevant variables @xmath263 is uniformly chosen from @xmath264 , this gives the equality of the probabilities for each @xmath241 with a new @xmath259 when the function is drawn from @xmath171 . \n the argument for the case of @xmath170 is clear . \n consequently the statistical difference between the distributions corresponding to the sequence of outcomes of the @xmath235 @xmath2 oracle calls under the two distributions is at most @xmath265 . \n now fact  [ dpi ] implies that no algorithm making only @xmath235 oracle calls can distinguish between these two scenarios with high probability . \n this gives us the result , and concludes the proof of theorem  [ s1qthm2 ] . \n intuitively , under either distribution on functions , each element of a sequence of @xmath235 @xmath2 oracle calls will `` look like '' a uniform random draw @xmath262 from subsets of @xmath266 and @xmath191 from @xmath267 where @xmath191 and @xmath262 are independent . note that this argument breaks down at @xmath268 . \n this is because if the algorithm queried the @xmath2 oracle @xmath269 times it will start to see some @xmath270 s more than once with constant probability ( again by the birthday paradox ) . \n but when the functions are drawn from @xmath171 the corresponding @xmath108 s will always have a fixed parity for a given @xmath270 whereas for functions drawn from @xmath170 the parity will be random each time . \n this will provide the algorithm with sufficient evidence to distinguish with constant probability between these two scenarios . \n the problem of learning an unknown @xmath0-junta has been well studied in the computational learning theory literature , see e.g. @xcite . \n the following classical lower bound will be a yardstick against which we will measure our results . \n [ s2lem1 ] any classical membership query algorithm for learning @xmath0-juntas to accuracy @xmath271 must use @xmath22 membership queries .    consider the restricted problem of learning an unknown function @xmath10 which is simply a single boolean variable from @xmath272 . \n since any two variables disagree on half of all inputs , any @xmath271-learning algorithm can be easily modified into an algorithm that exactly learns an unknown variable with no more queries . \n it is well known that any set of @xmath1 concepts requires @xmath273 queries for any exact learning algorithm that uses membership queries only , see e.g. @xcite . \n this gives the @xmath273 lower bound .    for the @xmath274 lower bound \n , we may suppose that the algorithm `` knows '' that the junta has relevant variables @xmath275 . \n even in this case , if fewer than @xmath276 membership queries are made the learner will have no information about at least @xmath277 of the function s output values . \n a straightforward application of the chernoff bound shows that it is very unlikely for such a learner s hypothesis to be @xmath271-accurate , if the target junta is a uniform random function over the relevant variables . \n this establishes the result . \n learning juntas from uniform random examples @xmath47 is a seemingly difficult computational problem . \n simple algorithms based on exhaustive search can learn from @xmath278 examples but require @xmath279 runtime . \n the fastest known algorithm in this setting , due to mossel _ \n et al . _ , uses @xmath280 examples and runs in @xmath280 examples time , where @xmath281 is the matrix multiplication exponent @xcite . \n bshouty and jackson @xcite gave an algorithm using uniform quantum examples from the @xmath53 oracle to learn general @xmath12 formulas . \n their algorithm uses @xmath282 calls to @xmath53 to learn an @xmath217-term @xmath12 over @xmath1 variables to accuracy @xmath4 . since any @xmath0-junta is expressible as a @xmath12 with at most @xmath283 terms , their result immediately yields the following statement . \n [ s2thm2 ] there exists an @xmath34-learning quantum algorithm for @xmath0-juntas using @xmath284 quantum examples under the uniform distribution quantum pac model . \n note that @xcite did not try to optimize the quantum query complexity of their algorithms in the special case of learning juntas . \n in contrast , our goal is to obtain a more efficient algorithm for juntas . \n the lower bound of ( * ? ? ? \n * observation  6.3 ) for learning with quantum membership queries for an arbitrary concept class can be rephrased for the purpose of learning @xmath0-juntas as follows . \n [ s2fac1 ] any algorithm for learning @xmath0-juntas to accuracy @xmath285 with quantum membership queries must use @xmath274 queries .    since we are proving a lower bound we may assume that the algorithm is told in advance that the junta depends on variables @xmath286 consequently we may assume that the algorithm makes all its queries with nonzero amplitude only on inputs of the form @xmath287 . \n now ( * ? ? ? \n * observation  6.3 ) states that any quantum algorithm which makes queries only over a shattered set ( as is the set of inputs @xmath288 for the class of @xmath0-juntas ) must make at least vc - dim(@xmath31)/100 @xmath50 queries to learn with error rate at most @xmath289 ; here vc - dim(@xmath31 ) is the vapnik - chervonenkis dimension of concept class @xmath31 . \n since the vc dimension of the class of all boolean functions over variables @xmath275 is @xmath290 , the result follows . \n this shows that a @xmath50 oracle can not provide sufficient information to learn a @xmath0-junta using @xmath291 queries to high accuracy . \n it is worth noting that there are other similar learning problems known where an @xmath235-query @xmath50 algorithm can exactly identify a target concept whose description length is @xmath292 bits . \n for instance , a single @xmath2 oracle call ( which can be implemented by a single @xmath50 query ) can potentially give up to @xmath0 bits of information ; if the concept class @xmath31 is the class of all @xmath290 parity functions over the first @xmath0 variables , then any concept in the class can be exactly learned by a single @xmath2 oracle call . \n note that all the results we have discussed in this subsection concern algorithms with access to only one type of oracle ; this is in contrast with the algorithm we present in the next section . \n the motivating question for this section is : `` is it possible to reduce the classical query / sample complexity drastically for the problem of junta learning if the learning algorithm is also permitted to have very limited quantum information ? '' we will give an affirmative answer to this question by describing a new algorithm that uses both @xmath2 queries ( i.e. quantum examples ) and classical uniform random examples . \n [ s1qlem1 ] let @xmath32 be a function whose value depends on the set of variables @xmath293 . \n then there is an algorithm querying the @xmath2 oracle @xmath294 times which w.h.p . \n outputs a list of variables such that    * the list contains all the variables @xmath73 for which @xmath295 ; and * all the variables @xmath296 in the list have non - zero influence : @xmath297 . \n the algorithm simply queries the @xmath2 oracle @xmath298 many times and outputs the union of all the sets of variables received as responses to these queries . \n if @xmath295 then the probability that @xmath73 never occurs in any response obtained from the @xmath235 @xmath2 oracle calls is at most @xmath299 the union bound now yields that with probability at least @xmath130 , every @xmath73 with @xmath295 is output by the algorithm . \n [ s2thm3 ] there is an efficient algorithm @xmath34-learning @xmath0-juntas with @xmath7 queries of the @xmath2 oracle and @xmath300 random examples . \n we claim algorithm  1 satisfies these requirements .    * \n input : * @xmath301 . * \n stage 1 : * construct a set containing all variables of @xmath3 with an influence at least @xmath302 using the algorithm in lemma  [ s1qlem1 ] . \n let @xmath78 be the final result . \n * stage 2 : * @xmath304 draw from @xmath47 . \n let @xmath305 denote the projection of @xmath9 onto the variables in @xmath78 . \n @xmath306 . . \n output the hypothesis : @xmath307    assume we are given a boolean function @xmath3 whose value depends on the set of variables @xmath293 with @xmath308 . \n by lemma  [ s1qlem1 ] , @xmath7 queries of the @xmath2 oracle will reveal all variables with influence at least @xmath302 with high probability during stage 1 . \n assuming the algorithm of lemma  [ s1qlem1 ] was successful , we group the variables as follows :    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     note that @xmath309 by lemma  [ s1qlem1 ] and by the assumption that @xmath3 is a @xmath0-junta . \n we reorder the variables of @xmath3 so that the new order is @xmath310 for notational simplicity , i.e. @xmath3 is now considered to be over @xmath311 . \n we will denote an assignment to these variables by @xmath312 .    in stage 2 \n the algorithm draws random examples until at least @xmath313 fraction of all assignments to the variables in @xmath78 are observed . \n let us call this set of assignments by @xmath103 , and for every @xmath314 , let us denote the first example @xmath315 drawn in stage 2 for which @xmath316 by @xmath317 . at the end of the algorithm , \n the following hypothesis is produced as the output : @xmath318 in other words , the value of the hypothesis only depends on the setting of the variables in @xmath78 . \n observe the probability that any given setting of a fixed set of variables in @xmath78 has not been seen can be made less than @xmath319 using @xmath320 uniform random examples . \n therefore the linearity of expectation implies that after @xmath320 random examples , the expected fraction of unseen assignments is @xmath321 . \n thus by markov s inequality the fraction of unseen assignments will be @xmath322 w.h.p . hence stage 2 \n will terminate w.h.p . \n after @xmath320 random examples . \n consequently , the whole algorithm terminates with high probability with the desired query consumption . \n all we need to verify is that the hypothesis constructed is @xmath34-accurate . \n * the hypothesis @xmath323 is @xmath34-accurate with high probability : *    we introduce some notation : let @xmath324 ; and given two strings @xmath325 , let @xmath326 denote the bitwise multiplication between @xmath327 ; and let @xmath328 denote the total number of @xmath25 s in @xmath329 \n . also let @xmath330 denote the indicator function that takes value @xmath26 if @xmath331 holds and value @xmath332 \n if @xmath331 is false .    we start with the following fact :    [ fac : stupidfact ] for any @xmath333 , we have @xmath334 } < { \\epsilon}/10 $ ] . \n given any string @xmath335 , clearly there exists a sequence of @xmath336 strings : @xmath337 therefore , @xmath338 } \\\\ \n & \\leq\\frac{1}{2^{n } } \\displaystyle\\sum_{\\mathbf{a}\\in\\mathbb{b}^{|\\mathcal{a}| } }          \\sum_{\\mathbf{b}\\in\\mathbb{b}^{|\\mathcal{b}| } } \\sum_{\\mathbf{c}\\in\\mathbb{b}^{|\\mathcal{c}|}}\\sum_{i=1}^{|s|}\\mathbf{1}_{[f(\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b}\\odot u^{i+1},\\mathbf{c})\\neq f(\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b}\\odot u^{i},\\mathbf{c } ) ] } \\\\          & = \\sum_{i=1}^{|s|}\\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{1}{2^{n } } \\displaystyle\\sum_{\\mathbf{a}\\in\\mathbb{b}^{|\\mathcal{a}| } }          \\sum_{\\mathbf{b}\\in\\mathbb{b}^{|\\mathcal{b}| } } \\sum_{\\mathbf{c}\\in\\mathbb{b}^{|\\mathcal{c}|}}\\mathbf{1}_{[f(\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b}\\odot u^{i}\\odot u^{i+1},\\mathbf{c})\\neq f(\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b},\\mathbf{c})]}\\right)}_{=\\text{the influence of the unique variable $ b_{j(i)}$ that takes value $ -1 $ in $ u^{i+1}\\odot u^{i}$}}\\\\          & < { \\epsilon}/10.\\quad [ \\text{since every $ b_j\\in\\mathcal{b}$ has influence $ < \\frac{{\\epsilon}}{10k}$ and $ |\\mathcal{b}|\\leq k$ } ]      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for each @xmath339 , consider a fixed setting of strings @xmath340 , @xmath341 . let us call the list of all these assignments @xmath342 , i.e. @xmath343 for any such `` list of assignments '' @xmath342 , we define the function @xmath344 as follows : @xmath345 . \n the error incurred by approximating @xmath3 by @xmath346 is : @xmath347          = { \\mathbf{pr}}_{(\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b},\\mathbf{c})}[f(\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b}^{\\mathbf{a}},\\mathbf{c}^{\\mathbf{a}})\\neq f(\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b},\\mathbf{c})]\\ ] ] @xmath348\\quad          [ \\text{since $ f$ does not depend on the variables in $ \\mathcal{c}$}]\\ ] ] @xmath349 }          = \\frac{1}{2^{n } } \\displaystyle\\sum_{\\mathbf{a}\\in\\mathbb{b}^{|\\mathcal{a}| } } \\sum_{s\\in\\mathbb{b}^{|\\mathcal{b}| } } \\sum_{\\mathbf{c}\\in\\mathbb{b}^{|\\mathcal{c}|}}\\mathbf{1}_{[f(\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b}^{\\mathbf{a}},\\mathbf{c})\\neq f(\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b}^{\\mathbf{a}}\\odot s,\\mathbf{c})]}\\label{eqn : fgamma}\\ ] ]    therefore if we consider the expected value of the incurred error @xmath350 $ ] over all `` lists of assignments '' \n @xmath342 , equation   implies that : @xmath351&=\\frac{1}{2^{|\\mathcal{b}|}}\\sum_{s\\in\\mathbb{b}^{|\\mathcal{b}|}}\\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{1}{2^{n } } \\displaystyle\\sum_{\\mathbf{a}\\in\\mathbb{b}^{|\\mathcal{a}| } }          \\sum_{\\mathbf{b}^{\\mathbf{a}}\\in\\mathbb{b}^{|\\mathcal{b}| } } \\sum_{\\mathbf{c}\\in\\mathbb{b}^{|\\mathcal{c}|}}\\mathbf{1}_{[f(\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b}^{\\mathbf{a}}\\odot s,\\mathbf{c})\\neq f(\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b}^{\\mathbf{a}},\\mathbf{c})]}\\right ) } _ { < { \\epsilon}/10,\\ \\text{due to fact~\\ref{fac : stupidfact}}}\\\\          & < { \\epsilon}/10 . \n \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consequently , the expected error of approximating @xmath3 by a uniformly chosen @xmath346 is less than @xmath352 . \n this also implies that for a uniformly chosen subset @xmath103 of assignments to variables in @xmath78 with size @xmath353 , the expected error over @xmath103 satisfies : @xmath354 < { \\epsilon}/10 $ ] . \n therefore by markov s inequality , we obtain the following observation :    [ obs : jlproof]for a uniformly chosen subset @xmath103 and @xmath346 as described above , @xmath346 will agree with @xmath3 on @xmath355 fraction of the coordinates @xmath356 with probability at least @xmath357 . \n now if we go back and recall what the algorithm does in stage 2 , we will observe that the generation of the hypothesis in stage 2 is equivalent to drawing a uniform @xmath346 and @xmath103 as described and resetting the values of @xmath346 at those coordinates @xmath358 to true . \n this is because the algorithm only draws classical random examples during stage 2 . \n therefore due to observation  [ obs : jlproof ] , the hypothesis will disagree with @xmath3 on at most @xmath359 fraction of the inputs with overall probability at least @xmath36 . \n this gives the desired result . \n note that this algorithm    * uses only a moderate number of quantum examples ; * has overall query complexity with no dependence on @xmath1 , in contrast with known lower bounds ( lemma  [ s2lem1 ] ) for learning from classical membership queries ; * uses the @xmath46 oracle as its only source of classical information ( @xmath43 queries are not used ) ; and * is computationally efficient . \n one can compare this result to that of theorem  [ s2thm2 ] which requires @xmath284 quantum examples to learn @xmath0-juntas . \n in contrast , our algorithm uses not only substantially fewer quantum examples but also fewer uniform random examples , which are considered quite cheap . \n intuitively , this means that for the junta learning problem , almost all the quantum queries used by the algorithm of bshouty and jackson @xcite can in fact be converted into ordinary classical random examples . \n the algorithm of theorem  [ s2thm3 ] is optimal in the following sense :    [ obsjlrn ] any @xmath360-learning quantum membership query algorithm for @xmath0-juntas that uses only @xmath361 classical @xmath43 queries must additionally use @xmath362 @xmath50 queries . \n this statement easily follows from fact  [ s2fac1 ] since a classical membership query can be simulated by a @xmath50 query . \n contrasting our junta learning algorithm with observation  [ obsjlrn ] , we see that if the allowed number of classical examples or queries is decreased even slightly from the @xmath363 used by our algorithm to @xmath361 , then an additional @xmath362 quantum queries are required , even if @xmath50 queries are allowed . \n we have given some results on learning and testing @xmath0-juntas using both quantum examples and classical random examples . \n it would be interesting to develop other testing and learning algorithms that combine these two sorts of oracles , with the goal of minimizing the number of quantum oracle calls required . \n another interesting goal for future work is to further explore the power of the @xmath2 oracle . \n can the gap between our @xmath100-query upper bound and our @xmath6-query lower bound for the @xmath2 oracle be closed ? \n a. blum , _ learning a function of @xmath146 relevant variables ( open problem ) _ , proceedings of the 16th annual conference on learning theory and 7th kernel workshop , pp .  731733 ( 2003 ) . \n h. buhrman , l. fortnow , i. newman , h. rhrig , _ quantum property testing _ , proceedings of 14th soda , pp . \n 480488 ( 2003 ) . \n n. bshouty , r. cleve , r. gavald , s. kannan and c. tamon . _ \n oracles and queries that are sufficient for exact learning _ , j. comput \n , vol  * 52 * , no .  3 , pp . 421 - 433 ( 1996 ) . \n r. lipton , e. markakis , a. mehta , n. vishnoi , _ on the fourier spectrum of symmetric boolean functions with applications to learning symmetric juntas _ , proceedings of the 20th annual ieee conference on computational complexity , pp . \n 112119 ( 2005 ) . \n e. mossel , r. odonnell and r.  a. servedio , _ learning functions of @xmath0 variables _ , journal of computer and system sciences , vol . \n * 69 * , no .  3 , pp . \n 421434 ( 2004 ) . \n m. nielsen and i. chuang , _ quantum computation and quantum information _ , cambridge university press ( 2000 ) . \n r. odonnell , r.  a. servedio , _ extremal properties of polynomial threshold functions _ , journal of computer & system sciences , to appear . \n available at http://www.cs.columbia.edu/`~`rocco/papers/ccc03.html . \n preliminary version appeared in eighteenth annual ieee conference on computational complexity , pp . \n 312 ( 2003 ) . \n r. rubinfeld and m. sudan , _ robust characterizations of polynomials with applications to program testing _ \n , siam journal on computing , * 25*(2 ) : pp . \n 252271 ( 1996 ) .", "human_aspect": "{\n  \"background\": \"in this article we develop quantum algorithms for learning and testing _ juntas _ , i.e. boolean functions which depend only on an unknown set of @xmath0 out of @xmath1 input variables.\",\n  \"method\": \"our algorithms use only classical examples generated uniformly at random and fixed quantum superpositions of such classical examples ;

similar collapse are specified at an early time close to zero , @xmath36 , as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mean density contrast interior to @xmath23 , and @xmath10 . for cosmological initial conditions \n the initial density contrast must be tiny , so we will be interested in the solution in the region @xmath39 . \n a perturbation with @xmath40 can be realized by placing a high narrow positive density peak at the center ( @xmath41 ) of a symmetric void with local density contrast @xmath42 . \n the condition ( [ inivel ] ) means that a gas shell at @xmath23 moves initially with the general universal expansion . \n this condition can be relaxed to allow for a non vanishing initial zero peculiar velocity according to late time linear theory ( e.g. , peebles 1980 ) . \n however , this does not affect the details of the collapse ( peebles 1980 , bertschinger 1985 ) , so we use ( [ inivel ] ) which is commonly adopted in the literature . \n bertschinger ( 1985 ) and white & forcada ( 1997 ) , respectively , considered the collapse of spherical perturbations with @xmath43 , and @xmath44 . \n the equations of motion ( [ eom1][eom4 ] ) together with the initial conditions ( [ inid][inip ] ) are insufficient to completely determine the evolution of the perturbation . \n still missing is an inner boundary condition specifying the velocity and mass at @xmath45 , for @xmath46 . for a shock to develop without the accumulation of a central mass ( a black hole for @xmath47 ) we must have @xmath48 and @xmath49 . \n relaxing the condition @xmath50 leads to a non - vanishing central mass with or without the presence of a shock .    in a critical density universe ( @xmath51 ) \n the only length scale relevant to the collapse is the scale of non - linearity . at any time , \n @xmath52 , this scale can be defined as the distance of the shell at the maximum expansion , i.e. , the shell with @xmath53 ( gunn 1977 , fillmore & goldreich 1984 , bertschinger 1985 ) . \n this radius is termed the current turnaround radius , @xmath54 . \n starting from tiny initial density contrast , the mean overdensity ( density in units of @xmath55 ) interior to @xmath54 is a fixed number independent of time . for time \n @xmath56 , when shells with @xmath39 reach their turnaround , the collapse develops a self - similar behaviour that depends on @xmath23 and @xmath52 through the combination @xmath57 . \n the turnaround radius @xmath54 is given by ( e.g. , fillmore & goldreich 1984 ) , @xmath58 where , @xmath59 for @xmath60 and 3 , respectively . \n the turnaround radius grows faster than the scale factor @xmath61 . \n this is because the mass , @xmath62 , interior to @xmath63 must grow with time while the mass , @xmath64 , inside a fixed shell in a homogeneous universe is constant . for @xmath65 \n the turnaround radius grows faster than @xmath52 reaching the horizon scale in finite time . \n when this happens relativistic description must be used and @xmath63 ceases to be the only scale in the problem ( fillmore & goldreich 1984 ) .    the equations can be cast into a non - dimensional form using the scaled variables @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 defined by ( bertschinger 1985 ) , @xmath70 expressed in terms of these variables , the equations ( [ eom1]-[eom4 ] ) become , respectively , @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 where the prime symbol denotes derivatives with respect to @xmath75 . \n we will mainly be concerned with solutions for shocked collapse with vanishing mass at the center . \n the inner boundary condition appropriate for this collapse are vanishing mass and velocity at @xmath76 , i.e. , @xmath77 self - similarity implies that the shock appears at fixed @xmath78 , so the physical radius of the shock @xmath79 and its non - dimensional speed is @xmath80 . at the surface of the shock \n the fluid variables satisfy the jump conditions obtained from mass , momentum , and energy conservation . in terms of the non - dimensional fluid variables , \n the jump conditions appropriate for an adiabatic shock are , @xmath81 where the superscripts of the minus and plus signs refer to pre- and post - shock quantities . in employing energy conservation \n we have taken @xmath82 as the non - dimensional internal energy per unit mass .    in section \n [ numerical ] we will find numerical solutions satisfying the requirements for shocked collapse without a central mass . except spherical perturbations with @xmath83 only one value @xmath84 can yield solutions satisfying these requirements . \n spherical perturbations with @xmath83 allow a range of values for @xmath84 . before presenting the numerical solutions we derive in the next section the asymptotic behaviour of the fluid variables near the center , and two integrals of motion which will be used as a check on the numerical solutions . \n solutions to ( [ a1][a4 ] ) with the appropriate jump and boundary conditions for all @xmath85 will be found by numerical integration . \n we present here an analytic treatment of the equations to derive the asymptotic behaviour of the fluid variables near @xmath45 , and two integrals of motion ( e.g. , bertschinger 1983 , 1985 ) . \n we restrict the analysis shocked collapses satisfying the inner boundary condition ( [ innerb ] ) . \n all fluid variables can be expressed in terms of an auxiliary function @xmath86 as follows . \n @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are constants . \n the fluid variables in ( [ b6][b5 ] ) satisfy the non - dimensional equations ( [ a1 ] ) , ( [ a3 ] ) , and ( [ a4 ] ) for any functional form of @xmath90 . \n the function @xmath90 is then specified by only one equation , the non - dimensional euler equation ( [ a2 ] ) . \n two integrals of motion can immediately be found from ( [ b6][b5 ] ) . \n these are the mass and entropy integrals of motion ( bertschinger 1983 , 1985 ) , @xmath91 where all fluid variable are evaluated at any @xmath75 inside the shock . \n since @xmath92 , the entropy integral of motion means that the entropy @xmath93 is an increasing function of the mass and hence @xmath75 . \n the auxiliary function greatly simplifies the derivation of the asymptotic behaviour of the non - dimensional fluid variables near @xmath76 . \n since @xmath50 and @xmath94 , equations ( [ b6 ] ) and ( [ b5 ] ) imply that , to first order , @xmath95 must approach @xmath96 as @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is an arbitrary constant . substituting this expression for @xmath90 in ( [ b6 ]  [ b5 ] ) , yields @xmath99 and \n the asymptotic exponents are expressed in terms of the coefficient @xmath98 as @xmath100 these relations have been obtained without using the euler equation ( [ a2 ] ) . in order to determine the exponents uniquely we use the euler equation which adds the following constraints , @xmath101 a value @xmath102 gives @xmath103 and so , by ( [ int : ent ] ) , a negative entropy integral of motion . \n but the jump condition ( [ jump3 ] ) gives positive pressure , @xmath104 , just behind the shock and since the density and mass are also positive , the entropy integral ( [ int : ent ] ) must be positive . \n so we rule out @xmath105 . \n if the solution to ( [ expdelta ] ) , ( [ expeta ] ) , and ( [ expeuler ] ) is @xmath106 then the euler equation also provides the following constraint on the coefficients @xmath89 and @xmath88 , @xmath107 table 1 lists the values of @xmath98 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 in all cases . \n the dashed curves in figure [ fig : delta ] are a graphical representation of the density exponent @xmath109 versus @xmath110 for @xmath111 . in planar geometry , \n @xmath112 , the only possible solution to equations is @xmath113 and the pressure is finite everywhere . in cylindrical geometry , \n @xmath114 , we have @xmath115 only for @xmath116 , so it must be zero for other values of @xmath117 . \n in spherical geometry , @xmath47 , if @xmath118 and @xmath3 then @xmath119 , and @xmath120 meaning that @xmath121 , where @xmath122 . \n a second order expansion gives @xmath123 $ ] , where only one of the roots is @xmath122 . in the limit of either @xmath124 or @xmath125 \n , we have @xmath126 .    for @xmath47 and @xmath83 the relations ( [ expdelta ] ) , ( [ expeta ] ) , and ( [ expeuler ] ) allow multiple solutions for @xmath98 and consequently for @xmath84 . \n a second order calculation gives the upper limit @xmath127 . \n solutions exist for any positive @xmath84 smaller than a maximal value which corresponds to the upper limit on @xmath98 . \n this means that for @xmath83 a shocked collapse can not be accompanied by the presence of a non - vanishing mass at the center . in the table \n we list the asymptotic constants corresponding to @xmath128 , i.e. , the maximal value of @xmath84 for which a shocked collapse occurs . \n bertschinger ( 1984 ) does not mention that there are solutions for shocked without a central mass for a range of @xmath84 . \n his numerical solution with @xmath83 seems to correspond to the maximal @xmath84 and yields @xmath129 and @xmath130 , instead of @xmath131 and @xmath132 as listed in table 1 . \n we now examine how the dimensional density , @xmath133 , varies with time near the center . using @xmath134 , the first order expression @xmath135 , and @xmath136 \n , we find @xmath137 . when @xmath138 the density is constant with time . \n in spherical geometry a time independent density is equivalent to @xmath120 . because of the expansion in the @xmath139 directions , a vanishing @xmath98 in planar and cylindrical geometries leads to @xmath140 . in all geometries \n a vanishing @xmath141 indicates that , to first order in the asymptotic expansion , the gas is pressure supported in hydrostatic equilibrium . according to the table , spherical \n perturbations have @xmath120 only for @xmath142 . \n note that for @xmath143 the asymptotic density is constant even though the temperature @xmath144 decreases inward . for @xmath145 , \n the density increases with time . according to table 1 , planar and cylindrical perturbations \n have @xmath120 only at @xmath146 and @xmath147 , respectively . \n we present results of the numerical integration of the non - dimensional equations of motion . \n the numerical solutions shown here describe shocked collapses without a central mass . outside the shock \n the fluid variables are given from the solution for collapse with zero pressure ( zeldovich 1970 , peebles 1980 , fillmore & goldreich 1984 ) . \n the shock position @xmath84 is unknown a priori . \n we have to find its value such that the fluid variables satisfy the equations of motion , ( [ a1][a4 ] ) , the jump conditions , ( [ jump1][jump4 ] ) , and the inner boundary condition , ( [ innerb ] ) . assuming that the pre - shock variables are given from the zero pressure solution \n , the value of @xmath84 can be found as follows ( bertschinger 1985 , forcada \n miro & white 1997 ) . for an assumed value for @xmath84 \n , we obtain the post - shock variables using the jump conditions . \n we then integrate the equations of motion from @xmath84 inward to @xmath76 , and tune @xmath84 so that the solution gives @xmath148 and @xmath149 at @xmath76 . in all numerical solutions \n we find that if @xmath94 for a given @xmath84 then @xmath50 , and vice verse . \n the zero pressure solutions in planar and spherical geometries are known analytically ( zeldovich 1970 , fillmore & goldreich 1984 ) so the pre - shock fluid variable can be found directly , for an assumed @xmath84 . however in cylindrical geometry an analytic solution is not available and we numerically integrate the equations with zero pressure to obtain the pre - shock quantities . in practice we use numerical integration also in planar and spherical geometries . \n it is convenient to integrate the zero pressure equations from @xmath150 , i.e. , the turnaround radius , to @xmath84 . at @xmath150 \n the fluid variables are @xmath151 @xmath152 where the expressions for @xmath153 and @xmath154 were obtained from the zero pressure solution ( e.g. , fillmore & goldreich 1984 ) . \n the sequence of figures ( [ fig : dens][fig : term ] ) shows the numerical solutions for the over density @xmath155 , the pressure @xmath156 , the velocity @xmath157 , and the thermal energy @xmath158 in spherical , cylindrical and planar geometries for several values of @xmath110 , all as a function of @xmath75 . \n all curves are obtained from the solutions with @xmath111 . \n the solid curve in each plot corresponds to @xmath159 . \n the sudden change in the fluid variables indicate the location of the shock . \n all numerical solutions satisfy the integrals of motion ( [ int : mass ] ) and ( [ int : ent ] ) up to the numerical accuracy and agree with asymptotic behaviour of the previous section . \n the logarithmic slopes of all curves match the corresponding values listed in table 1 . \n spherical perturbations with @xmath43 and @xmath160 were , respectively , analyzed by bertschinger ( 1984 ) and forcada  miro & white ( 1997 ) . \n the agreement between their solutions with @xmath111 and ours is excellent . in all geometries \n the density and pressure in the shock are higher for larger @xmath110 . \n figures [ fig : vel ] of the velocity and figure [ fig : term ] of the internal energy @xmath158 demonstrate that particles are decelerated at the shock converting most of their kinetic energy into heat . \n the velocity near the center of cylindrical perturbations can be positive inside the shock , hence the linear vertical scale in velocity plot in this case .    in figure \n [ fig : lam ] we plot the location of the shock @xmath84 as a function of @xmath110 for several values of @xmath6 . \n the shock location always increases with @xmath161 and agrees with the values obtained by bertschinger ( 1985 ) and forcada - miro & white ( 1997 ) for spherical perturbations with @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively . \n a special case is spherical collapse with @xmath83 . here \n a solution for shocked collapse without a central point mass is possible for any @xmath162 less than a maximal value @xmath163 . in this case \n we plot the maximal value @xmath164 . \n for @xmath165 , @xmath84 can exceed unity increasing to a finite value as @xmath166 . \n the variation of the fluid variables attached to a given fluid elements are also of interest . using the velocity obtained from the self - similar solutions we can calculate the trajectory @xmath167 of a fluid element ( particle ) as a function of time . the fluid variable associated with the particle at any time \n can then be obtained by interpolating the solutions at the particle s position at that time . \n the three panels from top to bottom in figure [ fig : traj ] show , respectively , the trajectory , density , and pressure of a particle as obtained from the solutions with @xmath111 for three values of @xmath110 . \n the time axis in all panels is @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the time at which the particle reached its maximum expansion ( the turnaround time ) . \n the particle position , @xmath23 , density @xmath170 , have been scaled by their values at @xmath169 , @xmath171 , and @xmath172 , respectively . \n the pressure , @xmath173 , has been scaled by its value at the shock @xmath174 . with this scaling the curves in the figures \n become valid for all the particles . \n the particle trajectory for @xmath175 ( solid line , top panel ) agrees with the corresponding curve in figure 4 of bertschinger ( 1985 ) . as expected from the asymptotic solution the particles for @xmath43 and @xmath176 tend to settle at a physical distance which is a fixed fraction of their turnaround radii . \n the decay of the trajectory for @xmath177 at late time can be evaluated using the asymptotic expansion . \n near the origin @xmath178 , so @xmath179 and @xmath180 . \n according to table 1 @xmath181 for @xmath177 and @xmath111 so @xmath23 decays like @xmath182 . \n the density ( middle panel ) and pressure ( bottom ) curves for @xmath43 and @xmath176 flatten at late times , consistent with the settling of the particles to a constant @xmath23 . \n so far we have considered similarity solutions for collapse involving gas only . \n the collapse of scale free symmetric perturbations in a an einstein - de sitter universe containing a mixture of gas and collisionless matter is also self - similar . \n similarity solutions for mixed collapse are beyond the scope of the present paper . here \n we only obtain the asymptotic behaviour of the gas variables in a universe dominated by collisionless matter . for a self - similar collapse to develop \n , the two matter components must start with the same initial conditions with zero initial gas pressure . \n shells of gas and collisional matter then move together until they reach either a shock in the gas or the region of shell crossing in the collisionless component \n . the evolved density profiles of both components depend on @xmath23 and @xmath52 through @xmath75 \n . although the global gas mass fraction is negligible , the gas can be gravitationally dominant at the center of the collapse if it has a steeper density profile than the collisionless matter . for the purpose of deriving the asymptotic exponents we proceed assuming that the gravity of the gas is negligible everywhere and check the consistency of this assumption according to the results . \n so we replace the gas mass @xmath69 in the non - dimensional euler equation ( [ a2 ] ) by the collisionless matter mass @xmath183 . \n writing @xmath184 near @xmath76 , fillmore & goldreich ( 1984 ) find that @xmath185 is @xmath186 @xmath187 @xmath188 table 2 summarizes the values of the asymptotic constants obtained by substituting the asymptotic behaviour of the collisionless mass in the non - dimensional euler equation . \n the dotted and dashed curves in figure [ fig : delta ] represent the density exponent vs @xmath110 computed from table 1 and table 2 , respectively , for @xmath111 . \n the solid curve is the collisionless matter exponent @xmath185 versus @xmath110 .    in spherical perturbations we see from the tables and figure [ fig : delta ] that the asymptotic gas density profile in a universe with collisionless matter is steeper than that containing gas only . \n for @xmath189 the density asymptotic exponents of the gas and collisionless matter are identical . for @xmath65 \n the collisionless matter density profile is steeper . \n this is consistent with neglecting the gravity of the gas near the center . \n as @xmath125 gas density exponent approaches @xmath190 for @xmath11 and @xmath191 otherwise , so the gas has the same asymptotic profile as the collisionless matter for all @xmath110 .    in cylindrical perturbations with @xmath110 large enough \n , the gas has a steeper density profile than the collisionless matter . \n this means that virial motions in the collisionless matter are more effective at balancing gravity than the gas pressure force . \n so for large @xmath110 the derivation of the asymptotic exponent in section [ asymptotic ] is more suitable . \n a steeper gas profile also occurs in planar perturbations with @xmath192 . however the asymptotic constants obtained here and in section [ asymptotic ] \n are identical in planar geometry .    in spherical perturbations with @xmath193 , \n the density @xmath26 is constant with time and the temperature @xmath194 diverges like @xmath195 as @xmath196 . to first order in the asymptotic expansion where the gas can be in hydrostatic equilibrium in the dominant potential well of the collisionless matter . \n for @xmath11 the density increases with time and the temperature is constant near the center . for comparison , in the absence of collisionless matter , for @xmath197 the temperature decreases inward but the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium to first order in the asymptotic expansion . \n the similarity solutions are found for collapse in a flat universe with matter density parameter @xmath198 . \n because of birchhoff s theorem , the solutions for spherical collapse are valid in an open universe if the current turnaround radius is well inside the spherical region interior to which the perturbation is bound . \n the statement is incorrect for planar and cylindrical perturbations because of the explicit appearance of cosmology dependent terms in the equations of motion ( [ eom1][eom4 ] ) , like @xmath199 in the continuity equation ( [ eom1 ] ) . \n the solutions are appropriate for the adiabatic collapse of perturbations with deep gravitational potential so that the initial thermal energy of the gas can be ignored . \n such perturbations are probably the seeds for massive galaxies , galaxy groups and clusters . in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) \n most of the gas is continuously photo - heated and is of moderate density . \n there is considerable interest in analytic modelling of the igm in current methods for extracting cosmological information from the lyman forest ( croft et . \n 1998 , nusser & haehnelt 1999 , 2000 ) . \n so far these methods have heavily relied on linear analysis ( e.g. , bi , brner , & chu 1992 , gnedin & hui 1998 , nusser 2000 ) and hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. , petitjean et . \n 1995 , theuns et . \n al . 1999 ) . \n analytic treatment of the igm beyond the linear regime is exceedingly complicated . \n consider a situation in which photo - heating establishes the relation @xmath200 in the igm , where @xmath201 and @xmath6 depend non - trivially on time ( e.g. , theuns et . \n al . 1999 ) . \n the pressure in this case introduces a length scale @xmath202 ( e.g. , sedov 1959 ) . \n if we take constant @xmath201 and @xmath6 , this length scale varies with time like @xmath63 only in the special case of @xmath83 and infinite @xmath110 . \n so physically interesting situations including initial pressure in which the collapse is self - similar do not exist . \n spherical perturbations with @xmath193 when @xmath3 , and with any @xmath203 when @xmath83 deserve special attention . in the corresponding solutions for shocked collapse without a black hole at the center \n , the quantity @xmath204 diverges towards the center , and so there is a point @xmath205 at which @xmath206 , where @xmath207 is the speed of light . \n according to general relativity this implies the presence of a black hole at the center , invalidating the assumption of no central mass , made in deriving the solutions . in particular , the condition @xmath208 , necessary for shocked collapse , is incompatible with the presence of a central black hole . \n near @xmath209 , however , radiation pressure and angular momentum can prevent the formation of a black hole . should this occur , we expect our solution for shocked accretion to be valid away from the central region \n .    the evolved gas variables in the symmetric self - similar collapse contain full information on the initial perturbation . \n so the system retains memory of the initial conditions , even in the highly nonlinear regime . on the other hand , \n a collapsing system of collisionless matter can develop density profiles which do not depend on the initial shape of the perturbation . \n for example , according to the solutions of fillmore & goldreich ( 1984 ) , a spherical density perturbation develops into @xmath17 for @xmath11 , and a cylindrical perturbation into @xmath210 for all @xmath110 . \n haloes identified in cosmological simulations of collisionless particles with generic initial conditions , also tend to have density profiles independent of the spectrum of the initial fluctuations ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) . \n our results are relevant for describing the gas distribution in various physical systems such as the cores of clusters or pancake - like superclusters . over a limited range of scales \n , the index @xmath110 can be related to the index , @xmath211 , of the three dimensional power spectrum , @xmath212 , of the linear density fluctuations . \n if the initial density field is gaussian with a scale free power spectrum then the properties of the nonlinear field depend only on one scale . \n this is the nonlinear scale , @xmath213 , defined as the scale on which the rms value of density fluctuations is unity . \n this scale grows with time like does not involve the dimension @xmath214 because @xmath211 refers to the three dimensional @xmath215 so the rms value on a scale @xmath216 is @xmath217 independent of @xmath214 . ] @xmath218 . by matching the time dependence of @xmath213 and @xmath219 \n we identify @xmath220 . \n so the collapse of gas into galaxies and clusters can be , respectively , modeled by our solutions for @xmath221 and @xmath222 , where we have taken @xmath223 and @xmath224 assuming a cold dark matter power spectrum . \n taking @xmath225 for collapse on a pancake - like large scale superclusters gives @xmath226 . \n another way to relate @xmath110 and @xmath211 is to identify symmetric perturbations with local maxima in the linear density field ( hoffman & shaham 1985 ) . \n the shape of high density peaks in a gaussian field varies with @xmath23 like the two - point correlation function , @xmath227 ( e.g. , bardeen et . \n al . 1986 ) . \n so , at least in the limit of high peaks , @xmath228 . on galaxy and cluster scales the relation @xmath228 , respectively , gives @xmath229 and @xmath230 in contrast to @xmath231 and @xmath222 obtained from @xmath220 . \n note however that gas in galaxies tends to settle into disks and so our solutions are less relevant than they are for cluster size objects . \n in spherical geometry the asymptotic behaviour shows that the gas can not be pressure supported if @xmath145 , and @xmath11 for collapse with , and without collisionless matter , respectively . \n estimates of the masses of rich galaxy clusters from x - ray observations of the intracluster gas rely on hydrostatic equilibrium ( e.g. , fabian 1994 ) . \n if on cluster scales @xmath232@xmath233 , then the asymptotic behaviour implies that the cluster gas may not be in hydrostatic equilibrium . how large is the error introduced in the mass estimates by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium ? \n the following argument shows that this error is negligible . \n hydrostatic equilibrium calculations neglect the term @xmath234 in the mass estimate . using \n the asymptotic expansion one finds that neglecting this term amounts to a relative mass error of @xmath235 where @xmath169 is the turnaround time of the shell present at @xmath23 at the current time @xmath52 . \n shells in the inner regions have passed their maximum expansion a few dynamical times ago . \n therefore @xmath236 and since @xmath237 we conclude that the error is negligible . \n the solutions are related to modelling the structure of haloes made of self interacting dark matter ( sidm ) ( spergel & steinhardt 1999 ) with large interaction cross section . on scales of massive galaxies and clusters , \n our results predict final density profile @xmath238 to @xmath239 . \n these profiles are consistent with the results obtained by moore et . \n al . in their simulations of sidm with large cross section . \n we thank the referee for useful comments . \n this research was supported by the israel science foundation founded by the israel academy of sciences and humanities , and by the fund for the promotion of research at the technion . \n bardeen j.m . , \n bond j.r . , kaiser n. , szalay a.s . , 1986 , \n apj , 304 , 15 benson , a.,j . , \n cole , s. , frenk , c.s . , \n baugh , c.m . , lacey , c.g . , 2000 , \n mnras , 311 , 793 bertschinger e. , 1985 , apjs , 58 , 39 bertschinger e. , 1983 , apj , 268 , 17 bi h.g . , brner g. , chu y. , 1992 , a&a , 266 , 1 cole , s. , aragon -

input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems in wireless communications provide significant improvements in wireless link reliability and the achievable capacity @xcite . \n recently , the systems with large number of antennas ( tens to hundreds of antennas ) called as _ large - mimo _ systems are getting increased attention @xcite because they provide additional multiplexing and diversity gains . using spatial multiplexing in mimo systems , \n multiple data streams can be transmitted simultaneously from different transmit antennas . however , the detection of these data streams at the receiver end is challenging . to achieve minimum bit error rate ( ber ) performance in mimo systems , an exhaustive search over all the possible transmit vectors \n is required . \n this is called as the maximum likelihood ( ml ) search for symbol vector detection in mimo systems . however , as the number of antennas grow , the number of possible transmit vectors also increases exponentially and thus the ml search becomes computationally impractical . \n sphere decoder , a well known mimo detector achieves near ml performance but is practical only up to limited number of dimensions @xcite . \n + the traditional mimo detection techniques involve linear detection such as zero forcing ( zf ) detector and minimum mean squared error ( mmse ) detector . \n these detectors use linear transformation of the received vector in order to estimate the transmitted symbol vector . \n comparatively the mmse detector is superior over zf detector in terms of ber performance , but still their performance is far inferior compared to the ml performance . \n another type of detection involve non - linear detectors such as vertical bell labs layered space time architecture ( v - blast ) @xcite which utilizes ordered sic for symbol vector detection . \n some of the other mimo detection technique involve ant colony optimization based mimo detection @xcite , message passing based algorithm @xcite , channel hardening based algorithm @xcite , and lattice reduction aided mimo detection @xcite . \n as an alternative , in this study we employ sic based detection technique for mimo detection problem . + sic based mimo detection is a well known detection technique where symbols are detected sequentially @xcite . in sic , after detecting each symbol , its interference is canceled from the received vector in order to improve the instantaneous signal to interference plus noise ratio ( sinr ) for the remaining symbols . \n it is also known as layered detection where in each layer , one symbol is detected . \n however , it suffers from error propagation which occur due to wrong decisions in early stages of the algorithm @xcite . for improving the performance of sic , a well known technique known as v - blast @xcite technique \n is used which performs the following steps : ( 1 ) snr based ordering in the detection sequence , ( 2 ) using zf or mmse for nulling the interference among the data streams and ( 3 ) detecting a symbol and canceling its interference i.e. sic . \n further , to mitigate the effect of error propagation , one of the available algorithms in the literature include multi - branch sic ( mb - sic ) algorithm @xcite where the concept of multiple branch ( mb ) processing is utilized . \n each branch of mb - sic differs in ordering of the detection sequence thus resulting in a higher detection diversity over the conventional sic . recently , a multiple feedback ( mf ) strategy is proposed in @xcite for sic based mimo detection . \n multiple feedback sic ( mf - sic ) algorithm proposed in @xcite is based on the concept of shadow are constraint ( sac ) where if the decision fall in the shadow region ( unreliability region ) then multiple constellation points are used in the decision feedback loop . the best symbol from the multiple symbols used in the decision feedback \n is selected using the ml criteria . \n + in this article , we propose an improved multiple feedback successive interference cancellation ( imf - sic ) for symbol vector detection in mimo spatial multiplexing systems . in mf - sic , once a decision falls into the shadow region , conventional sic is used to find the best one symbol for the corresponding layer . \n however , it may happen that while computing the best symbol for a given layer , multiple decisions from the subsequent layers fall into the shadow region . \n this condition is not checked in mf - sic which sometimes results in error propagation and limits the ber performance . in improved mf - sic ( imf - sic ) \n , we overcome this limitation by checking the shadow region criteria recursively rather than using the conventional sic for searching the best candidate symbol . \n this results in significant reduction in error propagation and thus the ber performance can be improved . also , we propose an ordered imf - sic ( oimf - sic ) algorithm where we employ the log likelihood ratio ( llr ) based dynamic ordering in the detection sequence @xcite . by the term \n dynamic ordering we mean that after every successful decision about a symbol , the ordering of the detection sequence is updated based on new llr values . in oimf - sic , same ordering pattern is followed even for searching the best symbol when a decision is found unreliable . \n simulation results show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the conventional sic and the mf -

wise noise variance . \n tr(@xmath25 ) denote the trace of a matrix , @xmath26 $ ] denote the expectation operation and @xmath27 denote the hermitian of a matrix . \n the channel state information ( csi ) is assumed to be perfectly known at the receiver but is unknown at the transmitter . \n the ml solution for a given received vector @xmath16 and a known channel matrix @xmath11 can be found as @xmath28 ml detection ( mld ) requires an exhaustive search over @xmath29 possible transmit symbol vectors where @xmath30 is cardinality of the constellation set @xmath8 . \n this search grows exponentially with increase in the modulation order ( @xmath30 ) or increase in the number of transmit antennas ( @xmath0 ) or both . \n in this section , we discuss some of the traditional mimo detection techniques such as linear detection techniques which involve zero forcing ( zf ) based mimo detection and minimum mean squared error ( mmse ) based mimo detection , and nonlinear detection techniques such as sic based mimo detection .      in zf based mimo detection , a linear transformation matrix @xmath31 is used in such a way that it removes the effect due to the channel impairments on the received vector @xmath16 i.e. @xmath32 which is the pseudo inverse of channel matrix @xmath11 . \n the linear transformation of the received vector using @xmath31 can be written as @xmath33 thus the zf estimate of the transmitted symbol can be found as @xmath34,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 $ ] is the quantization operation which maps the soft values on to the nearest constellation point . \n the computational complexity of zf receiver is very less , however the ber performance is far inferior to the ml performance . \n the main drawback of zf based mimo detection is the problem of noise enhancement which degrades its performance . \n mmse based mimo detection is based on finding a suitable linear transformation matrix which minimizes the mean squared error between the transmit vector @xmath36 and the transformed received vector as @xmath37.\\ ] ] the solution to eq . \n [ eq5 ] can be written as @xmath38 using the transformation matrix @xmath39 , the mmse solution can then be computed as @xmath40.\\ ] ] mmse based mimo detection overcomes the problem of noise enhancement in zf detectors . \n thus it achieves better ber performance over zf but still the performance of mmse receiver is inferior as compared to the ml performance . \n one more drawback is that the mmse solution needs knowledge of the noise variance @xmath24 .      in sic based mimo detection , \n the symbols transmitted from different transmit antennas are detected in a sequential manner . \n after detecting a symbol for a particular transmit antenna , its interference is canceled from the received vector in order to reduce the interference between different data streams at the receiver . \n the received vector in eq . [ eq1 ] can be rewritten as @xmath41 using the knowledge of channel matrix @xmath11 a filter @xmath42 is defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the matrix with its column taken from the @xmath45 to @xmath0 columns of the channel matrix @xmath11 . \n we use vector @xmath46 as the vector left after removing the interference due to @xmath47 as @xmath48 using @xmath42 , the first symbol @xmath2 is estimated as @xmath49=\\mathcal{q}[\\mathbf{w}_i^h\\mathbf{y}_i],\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is estimate of the transmitted symbol @xmath2 . \n @xmath42 , @xmath51 and @xmath46 are updated after every successful decision about a symbol . \n sic is an iterative detection technique , where in every iteration one symbol is detected . \n thus a total of @xmath0 iterations are performed to detect the complete symbol vector . \n a pseudo code of sic based mimo detection is given in algorithm [ algo1 ] . \n ; ; compute @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 $ ] update @xmath55 update @xmath56 $ ]    however , sic suffers from the problem of error propagation which occurs due to the wrong decisions in early stage of the algorithm . \n once an error occurs , it propagates to the later stages and thus increases the number of errors . \n this degrades the ber performance of sic based mimo detection . \n in this section , first we discuss the mf - sic based algorithm for symbol vector detection in mimo systems . we will then discuss the imf - sic algorithm and oimf - sic algorithm . \n the conventional sic suffers from the problem of error propagation which degrades the ber performance . as a solution to mitigate the effect of error propagation , mf strategy has been proposed in @xcite for sic based mimo detection . \n the mf strategy is based on the concept of reliability of a soft decision in sic . \n let us consider the @xmath57 soft decision within sic as @xmath58 the constellation point near to the soft decision @xmath59 is nothing but its quantized value i.e. @xmath60 $ ] . \n let us define the distance between the soft decision and its quantized value as @xmath61\\vert\\ ] ] if the soft decision in sic is within a predefined threshold radius @xmath62 ( i.e. if @xmath63 ) around the nearest constellation point then the decision is said to be reliable and its quantized value is used in the decision feedback . \n but if the decision is not within the radius ( if @xmath64 ) then multiple neighboring ( say @xmath65 ) constellation points are used instead of the quantized value followed by the conventional sic . it can be thought of as running parallel streams one for each symbol and at last the best one is selected using the ml metric ( eq . [ eq2 ] ) . \n mf - sic performs superior than the conventional sic in terms of ber . \n a pseudo code of mf - sic is shown in algorithm [ algo2 ]    ; ; compute @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath66\\vert$ ] @xmath54 $ ] @xmath67 i.e. initialize by @xmath68 neighborhood of @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 $ ] update @xmath72 update @xmath73 $ ] compute the solution vector @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 update @xmath55 update @xmath56 $ ]      in imf - sic , we propose an improved mf strategy for sic based symbol vector detection in mimo spatial multiplexing systems . in mf - sic algorithm \n @xcite , multiple feedback loops are followed by the conventional sic to check for the optimal decision for a particular layer . however , while searching for the optimal decision , the shadow region ( unreliability ) criteria is not considered in the lower layers and hence there are chances of selecting a sub - optimal decision about a symbol which degrades the ber performance . in order to improve the accuracy about a decision among multiple symbols in the feedback loop \n , we check the shadow region criteria recursively in imf - sic algorithm . \n we therefore formulate a separate sub - routine ( function ) named as imf_sic in algorithm [ algo3 ] which checks the unreliability condition and optimally decide the symbol . \n sub - routine imf_sic is called from the main function which is given in algorithm [ algo4 ] and also from the sub - routine itself . \n we denote the number of calls of the sub - routine by @xmath77 in imf - sic algorithm which is nothing but the number of times unreliability condition is checked once a decision falls into the shadow region . the number of neighboring symbol which are used in the decision feedback is denoted by @xmath65 . \n +    ; ; compute @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath66\\vert$ ] @xmath54 $ ] @xmath78 imf_sic(@xmath79 ) update @xmath55 update @xmath56 $ ]    function [ @xmath50]=imf_sic(@xmath79 ) @xmath67 i.e. initialize by @xmath68 neighborhood of @xmath69 \n @xmath54 $ ] @xmath78 imf_sic(@xmath81 ) update @xmath72 update @xmath73 $ ] compute the solution vector @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 return @xmath50    significant reduction in the effect of error propagation is noticed using imf - sic ( discussed in sect . \n [ sec5 ] ) which results in improvement in the ber performance over sic and the mf - sic . \n however , imf - sic does not include ordering in the detection sequence which plays a very important role in mitigating error propagation in sic based detection techniques . in the next section , \n we discuss ordered imf - sic ( oimf - sic ) algorithm for mimo detection .      in this section \n , we propose an ordered imf - sic ( oimf - sic ) algorithm which incorporates the llr based ordering in the detection sequence . \n error propagation can be mitigated successfully if the decisions in the early layers of sic are detected correctly . \n in several sic based detection algorithms , channel norm ordering is used such as in v - blast technique @xcite . \n however , channel norm ordering does not consider the instantaneous noise in the received vector which has a significant impact on the ber performance . \n thus a log likelihood ratio based ordering for multi - user detection in cdma systems @xcite has been proposed in @xcite for mf - sic based mimo detection to overcome the sub - optimal behavior of channel norm based ordering . \n we employ llr based dynamic ordering in the imf - sic algorithm to order the detection sequence . \n the term dynamic ordering is used in the sense that the ordering is updated after every successful symbol decision . however , the modification in the proposed method is that the ordering is also used in the oimf_sic sub - routine which help in a more precise decision . \n the llr value of a soft estimate @xmath82 can be written as @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 . \n the value of the argument @xmath85 which maximizes @xmath86 is arranged in descending order . \n let us consider a set @xmath87 be the set of indices of the symbols which are not detected so far . \n the set @xmath87 is updated after every successful decision . for ordering the detection sequence in every iteration we consider the indices which are in the set @xmath87 i.e. in eq . \n [ eq14 ] @xmath88 . \n let us also consider the ordered sequence @xmath89 which is updated in every iteration . in algorithm [ algo5 \n ] , we present the oimf - sic algorithm for mimo detection .    ; compute @xmath90 @xmath91 compute @xmath92 using the equation [ eq14 ] arrange the values @xmath93 in descending order update the detection order @xmath89 start detection using imf - sic given in algorithm [ algo3]with ordered sequence @xmath89 . \n in this section , we discuss the ber performance plots of the proposed algorithms and compare with the performance of the conventional sic and the mf - sic algorithm for @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 mimo systems with 4-qam and 16-qam signaling . \n the results are generated using matlab and the ber is averaged over @xmath97 monte - carlo simulations . + in fig . \n [ figs2 ] , we compare the ber performance of the conventional sic and mf - sic with the proposed algorithms for @xmath94 mimo system with 4-qam . the value of threshold parameter @xmath62 used is 0.2 and the number of recursions @xmath98 . \n observation reveals that the proposed algorithms achieve a near ml performance and also the performance of imf - sic and oimf - sic algorithms is similar in terms of ber performance . at ber of @xmath99 , \n imf - sic results in approximately 1 db gain in snr over mf - sic . in fig . \n [ figs3 ] , the ber performance is compared for @xmath95 mimo system with 4-qam . a significant improvement in the ber performance of imf - sic and oimf - sic can be seen over sic and mf - sic based mimo detection techniques . \n an snr gain of around 2 db can be achieved by using imf - sic over mf - sic to achieve a target ber @xmath100 . due to near optimal performance of imf - sic for @xmath94 and @xmath95 mimo systems with 4-qam the advantage of dynamic ordering can not be observed . however , with increase in number of antennas or the modulation order , ordering plays an important role in mitigating the error propagation . \n [ figs4 ] presents the ber performance comparison for @xmath96 v - blast mimo system with 4-qam . \n a significant improvement in the performance of oimf - sic can be seen when compared with imf - sic for @xmath98 . \n however , to achieve the near ml performance the number of recursions are increased to @xmath101 and @xmath102 for oimf - sic . \n thus , the effect of increase in number of recursions on the ber performance can be observed . \n +     v - blast mimo system with 4-qam and the value used for @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105.,width=9,height=10 ]     v -

blast mimo systems with 16-qam signaling is shown in figs . \n [ figs5 ] and [ figs6 ] . in 16-qam \n the total number of constellation points is 16 and hence in order to get a reliable decision , we keep the number of neighboring contellation point in the feedback as @xmath106 . \n the threshold value @xmath62 is kept same i.e. @xmath103 . \n it can be observed that the ber performance of oimf - sic is close to within the 0.1 db of the ml performance . ordering in imf - sic results in almost 1 db gain in snr over the imf - sic without ordering . \n however , in fig . \n [ figs6 ] , to achieve the ber close to ml , the number of recursions is increased to @xmath101 in oimf -

body correlations are sufficiently weak , and the eigenvalue equation of hamiltonian ( [ eq : full - hamiltonian ] ) is fulfilled so long as factors @xmath4 satisfy the pair equation @xmath5 the energy @xmath6 is equal to @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the eigenenergy of the many - body ground state , and must in fact vanish for an infinite system . \n we retain this term as our calculations use finite periodic systems and @xmath6 can be used to satisfy corresponding boundary requirements . \n direct solutions of the pair scattering equation similar to ( [ eq : pair - equation - f ] ) were used by pahnparipande @xcite as part of a variational ansatz for nuclear matter . however , as we will see below , direct solutions of this equation are far from optimal for our systems of interest . \n it was realized early on that the dominant contribution to the quality of the pair factor comes from its behavior at small distances , where the potential energy diverges for a hard - core interaction . \n indeed , to this day solving eq . \n ( [ eq : pair - equation - f ] ) to the first leading order at short distances remains the standard prescription when a simple , few - parameter function is desired . \n this is often understood as solving the kato cusp condition @xcite for the divergence in @xmath9 , similar to the way one handles interactions such as _ e.g. _ electronic states in the coulomb potential or states in a finite - strength contact potential . \n such terminology is not strictly correct for the potentials with analytical hard - core part . \n in fact , at short distances , the optimal pair factors for hard - core interactions vanish exponentially faster than the divergence of corresponding potential or kinetic energy contributions . \n the expectation values for both the potential and kinetic energies exist and carry no irregularities . \n likewise , the wavefunction has well - defined derivatives everywhere where it does not vanish . \n this is the reason why the leading - order solution of eq . \n ( [ eq : pair - equation - f ] ) can be additionally parametrized without forfeiting the variational principle . on the contrary , systems with true cusp condition \n must satisfy their cusp condition exactly in order to cancel non - analytic terms that arise in the schrdinger equationl ; such pair factors can not be meaningfully parametrized in the vicinity of the divergence . \n we write the pair factors in the positive - defined form as @xmath10 which is the conventional pseudopotential form but with the prefactor @xmath11 omitted for the sake of simplicity . \n the pair equation ( [ eq : pair -

equation - u - start ] ) is in fact @xmath16 and one has wkb - like solution @xmath17 and @xmath18 in practice , this solution does not yield an optimal energy but is in fact significantly improved by additional parametrization , @xmath19 where the constant @xmath20 can be determined by minimizing the variational energy . as mentioned above \n , such a parametrization is possible because every term of the pair equation ( [ eq : pair - equation - f ] ) remains analytical , and in fact even infinitely differentiable . \n indeed , @xmath21 moreover , the power of the divergence in @xmath22 can also be treated variationally for the same reason . \n the above approach alone allows to account for most of the correlation energy of the dense strongly correlated bosonic systems . \n numerous works have been devoted to improving the pair ansatz beyond the form of eq . \n ( [ eq : leading - term - u2 ] ) . \n one of the most studied systems in this regard is liquid helium-4 . \n this system has been the subject of about every quantum monte carlo method that is applicable , which included a large amount of work with explicit variational monte carlo with the jastrow ansatz . \n the simplest variational ansatz for helium consists of the parametrized leading - term solution proposed by mcmillan and by schiff and verlet @xcite , or similar solutions @xcite . \n the improvements beyond the leading order for helium can be seen as falling into the following categories : ( a ) addition to the leading term ( [ eq : leading - term - u2 ] ) of various explicit short- and long - range corrections derived from known general properties of the system @xcite , ( b ) parametrization of the mid - range behavior of @xmath22 focused primarily on improving the variational energy or structural properties @xcite , and ( c ) extracting the solution to the pair equation ( [ eq : pair - equation - u - start ] ) beyond the leading order , or using such solutions as a basis set @xcite . \n these approaches are considered in some detail below . \n additionally , one can use the pair functions obtained with paired phonon analysis ( ppa ) method @xcite . \n for instance , ppa optimization of campbell and pinski was used as a guiding function in ref .  . \n this method requires the hnc approximation and is out of our scope . \n the best forms of the jastrow function miss the ground state of liquid helium by about one degree kelvin per particle . \n a large part of this energy can be accounted for by including three - body correlations into the wavefunction @xcite . \n partially , the three - body correlations can be captured by the shadow wavefunction ( swf ) method @xcite which has since taken over explicit wavefunctions for the variational description of liquid helium . \n however , our interest is limited to the explicit jastrow pair terms . \n \\(a ) this approach relies on knowing the general properties of the static structure function of the system . \n it allows to recreate the physically important features that otherwise are missed by the leading - order solution . \n most remarkable of these corrections is the infinite - range tail in @xmath22 which must arise in the presence of zero - point phonons in the system @xcite . \n other corrections to @xmath22 were initially tied to the mid - range excitation structure of helium , that is , to the presence of the roton minimum @xcite . \n as the mid - range behavior is critical for achieving good varitational energy , parametrising @xmath22 in this region has a significant impact on the variational energy , disregarding the origin of such correction . \n overall , this approach leads to a rapid escalation of the parametrization of the pair factor . \n the leading order term must still be present , contributing one or two parameters . \n the phonon tail adds between one and two parameters ( speed of sound , and a distance cutoff @xmath23 ) , and at least three parameters are required for a simple gaussian mid - range correction ( its location , width and strength ) . \n \\(b ) if one is solely interested in minimizing the variational energy , or in replicating a known observable such as the pair distribution function , it is possible to this end to employ heavy parametrization of the pair function @xcite . \n such attempts have been quite successful , but in all cases relied on on using six and more parameters . \n here we are seeking approaches that are much straight - forward methodologically . \n \\(c ) trying to directly solve the pair scattering equations leads to the pair functions that are extremely poor in accounting for the correlation energy . \n moreover , as will be shown below , such energies depend very strongly on the size of the simulation cell . \n pandharipande and schmidt used the solutions of the pair equation as a variational anzatz for helium @xcite . a sharp cutoff allowed to limit the energy divergence , and the offset @xmath24 in ref . \n , used to satisfy boundary condition for @xmath4 at the cutoff , is equivalent to @xmath6 in ( [ eq : pair - equation - u - start ] ) . \n unfortunately , the energy in ref .   was extracted in an approximate way . a more productive approach , with excellent variational results , \n was reported by vitiello and schmidt in . \n it was shown that when the pair equation is treated as an eignevalue problem , the set of lowest eigenfunctions can be used as a basis for expressing the pair function . \n that is , their approach uses the pair equation as a _ source _ of good variational functions . on the other hand , \n the need to combine multiple eigenstates means one has once again to deal with as many as ten variational parameters . \n this work can be seen as extending the approach of pandharipande and schmidt . \n however , instead of parametrizing a linear combination of functions arising from the pair equation , we choose to parametrize the equation itself . \n the pair function is selected from the space of solutions of a modified and parametrized version of the differential eq . \n ( [ eq : pair - equation - u - start ] ) . \n straight - out solution of the pair eq . \n ( [ eq : pair - equation - u - start ] ) for any potential with an attractive part of the potential contains an exaggerated feature at mid - range separations . \n the larger is the simulation cutoff , the further is the solution cutoff , and the stronger becomes this peak . \n example solutions for helium are shown in fig . \n ( [ fig : u2straight ] ) . \n we observed that this feature is especially sensitive to the presence of the second term on the l.h.s . of  eq .

on model , but according to @xcite the present angle between the lmc disk and the orbital motion is nearly @xmath6 . even in the absence of precession and nutation , this angle is subjected to large variations during the orbital period in such a way that compression produced by the external hot gas can affect in time both edge - on and face - on .    moreover , the ram - pressure felt by the lmc is not constant and has a maximum when the satellite approaches the perigalacticon . \n the motion of the lmc through the hot halo of the mw during the last 1 gyr is modeled using `` test wind tunnel '' simulations with increasing ram - pressure values . \n the paper is structured as follows . \n section 2 describes the models and the star formation criteria adopted , section 3 illustrates the results of simulations without star formation , focussed on the investigation of pure effects of compression on the lmc interstellar medium while section 4 describes the runs where star formation is activated . \n several simulations have been performed , assuming different star formation models , disk inclinations and hot halo densities . \n the initial conditions of the simulations are constructed using the technique described by @xcite . \n our disk galaxy model is a multi - component system with a stellar and gaseous disk embedded in a spherical nfw @xcite dark matter halo . \n the density profile of the dark matter halo is adiabatically contracted in response to baryonic infall @xcite . \n the stellar disk follows an exponential surface density profile of the form : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the disk mass and radial scale length ( in cylindrical coordinates ) , respectively , while the thin vertical structure has a scale length @xmath10 : @xmath11 the gaseous disk is characterized by an exponential profile with the same radial and vertical scale length as the stellar component and by a constant density layer which extends up to 8@xmath9 . \n the structural parameters of the disk and the halo are chosen so that the resulting rotation curve resembles that of a typical bulgeless late - type ( sc / sd ) disk galaxy . \n they are similar to those adopted in m05 for the initial lmc model and reproduce quite well the peak of the rotation curve inferred by @xcite ( fig . \n as seen in m05 , the interaction with the mw does not affect significantly the stellar and dark matter mass in the inner @xmath12 kpc of the lmc and consequently the global rotation curve within this radial range . \n the choice of an extended gaseous component for the initial lmc model is motivated by the fact that spiral galaxies in the local universe are commonly observed to be embedded in extended disks of neutral hydrogen significantly larger than their stellar component . as seen in m05 , \n the combined effect of tidal interactions and ram - pressure stripping can remove a significant fraction of gas from a lmc disk orbiting within the hot halo of the mw , with a ram - pressure stripping radius which is a factor of three smaller than the initial radius of the gaseous disk . \n also in the case of a lmc with orbital velocities significantly higher @xcite hydrodynamic and gravitational forces together are effective in resizing and reshaping the extended gaseous disk of the satellite beyond 8 kpc . in the present work we neglect the presence of gravitational forces focusing on the effects of pure ram - pressure . \n therefore we do not expect to see a significant decrease in the radius of the gas distribution . \n however , in order to take in account the loss of cold gas from the disk of the satellite and the star formation events , we assumed an initial amount of gas in the disk which is about @xmath13 times larger than the hi mass in the lmc ( @xmath14 @xmath15 according to putman et al . \n 2003 ) . \n the mass within the virial radius is set equal to @xmath16 m@xmath17 and the fraction of mass in the disk is @xmath18 , equally distributed between the gaseous and stellar component . the contribution of the different components to the global rotation curve , assuming a disk scale length @xmath19 kpc and a dark halo concentration @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is defined as @xmath22 , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 virial and scale radius of the nfw halo , respectively ) is plotted in fig . \n [ rotcurve ] . \n the halo spin parameter , which sets the disk scale length in our modeling , is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 relates the angular momentum @xmath27 and the total energy @xmath28 of a system with virial mass @xmath29 through the relation @xmath30    the initial stellar disk of the satellite galaxy has , within its scale radius @xmath9 , a central mass surface density of @xmath31 ( fig . \n [ diskprofile ] ) , that corresponds to a b - band surface brightness of @xmath32 , assuming a mass to light ratio @xmath33 . \n the central gas surface density is only @xmath34 since a significant fraction of gas is distributed in the external disk . \n assuming @xmath35 hi abundance this value corresponds to an hydrogen column density of @xmath36 within @xmath9 , comparable with the values observed by @xcite with the lmc parkes multibeam hi survey .      in order to obtain a strongly stable disk against bar formation even in the presence of significant gas stripping and consequent perturbation of the satellite potential , the thickness of the stellar component is set such that the toomre s @xcite stability criterion is largely satisfied . \n in particular the toomre s parameter for the stellar disk :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the radial velocity dispersion , @xmath39 is the local epicyclic frequency and @xmath40 the unperturbed stellar surface density , has a minimum at the disk scale length with @xmath41 . for a gaseous disk the stability of the disk \n is expressed in terms of the gas sound speed @xmath42 and surface density @xmath43 through the relation : @xmath44 the gaseous disk has initially a constant temperature of 10000 k , which implies @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    according to and @xcite , the stability of a multicomponent disk \n is not guaranteed by the individual stability of its single constituents , due to the mutual gravitational interaction between gas and stars . \n stars are characterized by velocity dispersions 3 - 4 times larger than the typical sound velocities in the cold gaseous disk and even relatively small variations of the gaseous component parameters can significantly affect the stability of the whole disk . \n therefore we choose a large value of @xmath47 to contrast the effects of ram -

shocking , shearing environments . \n the code includes radiative cooling for a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium in collisional equilibrium . at temperatures below @xmath59 \n k the gas is entirely neutral and due to the lack of molecular cooling and metals , the efficiency of the cooling function drops rapidly to zero . \n we used a star formation recipe that includes density and temperature criteria , while converging flow criterium is not required in most of the simulations . \n gas particles are eligible to form stars only if the density of the star formation region has a minimum physical density corresponding to 0.1 hydrogen atoms per @xmath60 @xcite and an overdensity @xmath61 ( katz et al . 1996 ) , which basically restricts star formation to collapsed , virialized regions . the physical density threshold describes the steep drop in star formation rate observed in disk galaxies when the gas surface density is much lower than a critical value @xmath62 @xcite . \n the density threshold @xmath63 cm@xmath5 is compatible with observational results . according to @xcite , \n the star forming region has to be part of a converging flow that implies a local negative divergence of the sph velocity field . \n however , the converging flow criterium was introduced to describe star formation in cosmological simulations , where the geometry of the collapsing regions is approximatively spherical . in the case of star formation regions like 30 doradus , localized at the periphery of the lmc disk where gas particles relatively close in distance can have significantly different kinematics \n , this criterium leads to underestimate of the star formation rate . \n therefore the converging flow is not required in most of the simulations . a single run including \n the converging flow requirement has been performed for comparison . \n the star formation rate is assumed to be proportional to @xmath65 @xcite , where @xmath66 represents the volume density of the cold gas , and is given by the expression @xcite @xmath67 where the star formation timescale @xmath68 is the maximum between the local gas dynamical collapse time @xmath69 and the local cooling time . \n if the gas is already cool enough to form stars i.e @xmath70 , then @xmath71 is used . \n we assumed @xmath72k . \n the constant star formation rate parameter @xmath73 is chosen such that we reproduce the global lmc star formation rate @xcite . \n once a gas particle satisfies the above criteria , it spawns stars according to a probability distribution function . \n in particular , the probability @xmath74 that a gas particle forms stars in a time @xmath75 is modeled as @xmath76 a random number is then drawn to determine whether the gas particle forms stars during @xmath75 . \n for all the simulations in this paper @xmath77 myr . \n the newly created collisionless particle has the same position , velocity and softening length as the original gas particle while its mass is a fixed fraction @xmath78 of the parent gas particle , whose mass is reduced accordingly . following @xcite we assumed for our favorite models a star formation efficiency @xmath79 . \n up to six particles are then created for each gas particle in the disk . after its mass has decreased below @xmath80 of its initial value the gas particle is removed and its mass is re - allocated among the neighbouring particles .      in order to study the influence of pure ram pressure on a galaxy model orbiting in a milky way halo , we performed `` wind tunnel '' simulations where the ram - pressure value varies with time . \n we represent the hot gas as a flux of particles moving along the major axis of an oblong of base equal to the diameter of the dark matter halo of the satellite and height @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the velocity of the lmc at the perigalacticon and @xmath83 is the time scale of the simulation . \n the hot particles have an initial random distribution and a temperature @xmath84 . \n the box has periodic boundary conditions in order to restore the flow of hot gas that leaves the oblong . \n the galaxy model is at rest at the center of the oblong . \n kinematical data @xcite indicate that the lmc , presently located at @xmath85 kpc from the galactic center , is just past a perigalactic passage and has an orbital velocity of about 300 km s@xmath86 . \n recent proper motion measurements by @xcite and @xcite suggest that the velocity of the satellite is substantially higher ( almost 100 km s@xmath86 ) than previously estimated and consistent with the hypothesis of a first passage about the mw @xcite . in both scenarios \n the cloud is affected by the largest ram - pressure values during the last million years of its orbital evolution . indeed , while in the models proposed by @xcite the lmc does not enter the halo of the mw earlier than 1 gyr ago ( slightly different orbits are found in mastropietro 2008 ) , in m05 we have shown that the change in the orbital parameters due to dynamical friction strongly affects the ram - pressure stripping rate . even in the case of a `` low velocity '' model the largest ram - pressure on the satellite is expected during the last orbital semi - period ( about 1 gyr ) due to the increasing velocity and external gas density . \n we followed ram - pressure acting on the lmc s igm during the past 1 gyr . the density of the hot external gas increases with time , in such a way that in our low velocity model the external pressure experienced by the cold disk varies from @xmath87 to @xmath88 at the time corresponding to the pericentric passage . \n this is equivalent of assuming @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and a number density of the external gas that increases from @xmath91 to @xmath92 at @xmath85 kpc from the galactic center . \n these density values are comparable with those provided by m05 , who modeled the mw hot halo assuming a spherical distribution of gas that traces the dark matter profile , with a mean number density of @xmath93 within 150 kpc . \n we also consider the eventuality of a less dense galactic halo and performed runs where the gas density is a factor 10 lower . \n models with higher velocities @xcite and orbital parameters similar to those suggested by @xcite are also explored . in details \n , @xmath94 is the same as in the low velocity models since the higher orbital velocity at the beginning of the simulation ( about 250 km s@xmath86 ) is compensated by a lower external density ( @xmath95 , according to mastropietro 2008 . indeed 1 gyr ago the satellite has just passed through the virial radius of the mw ) . \n the maximum pressure felt by the disk is @xmath96 , that corresponds to a cloud moving with @xmath97 through an external hot medium of density @xmath92 . \n each galaxy model is simulated using 750000 particles , of which @xmath98 are in the dark halo and @xmath99 in the disk ( @xmath100 collisional and @xmath101 collisionless ) . \n the hot gas in the `` wind tunnel '' has @xmath102 particles , in such a way that the mass ratio @xmath103 between hot particles and particles in the disk is close to the unity even when the halo density is the largest . \n this choice permits to avoid the presence of scattering and numerical holes which artificially change the shape of the front edge and influence the morphology of the disk ( m05 ) . \n the gravitational spline softening is set equal to 0.5 kpc for the dark halo and the hot gas in the oblong , while it is 0.2 kpc for stars and gas in the disk . \n in order to study the effect of pure compression on the density distribution of cold gas in the lmc disk , we have run a first set of simulations where the gas cools radiatively but star formation was not activated .    according to @xcite and @xcite , the present angle between the lmc s disk and its proper motion vector \n is roughly @xmath6 . even neglecting the effects of precession and nutation on the disk plane of the satellite @xcite this angle \n is expected to vary significantly during an orbital period , especially in the proximity of a pericentric passage due to rapid changes in the velocity vector . \n different relative orientations of the disk with respect to the orbital motion are therefore investigated . \n the inclination angle @xmath55 is defined as the angle between the angular momentum vector of the disk and the flux of hot particles in the wind tube , so that a galaxy moving edge - on through the external medium is characterized by @xmath104 , while the observed lmc disk would have @xmath105 . \n we explored cases with inclination angle @xmath55 of 90 , 45 and @xmath106 ( runs cool90 , cool45 and cool10 , respectively ) .    with a hot halo temperature of @xmath107 k \n the relative velocity between the satellite and the external medium is supersonic ( sound speed @xmath108 km s@xmath86 and mach number @xmath109 and @xmath13 at the pericenter of the low and high velocity orbit , respectively ) and a bow shock forms in front of the disk ( fig . \n [ shockimage ] ) . \n since the cooling time of the post - shock gas is @xmath110 gyr , the shock can be considered adiabatic and hydrodynamical quantities at the two sides of the shock front are in first approximation related by the rankine - hugoniot equations for a stationary normal shock . \n = 8truecm    for @xmath111 the jump conditions give @xmath112 and @xmath113 , where subscripts 1 and 2 denote upstream and downstream quantities . \n the ram - pressure @xmath114 actually felt by the galaxy behind the shock front is therefore smaller than that it would suffer due to the upstream flux of hot particles , but conservation of momentum flux across the shock discontinuity implies that the reduction in dynamical pressure has to be balanced by an increase in thermal pressure ( see also rasmussen et al . \n 2006 ) .    fig . \n [ shock ] illustrates the behavior of hydrodynamical quantities across the shock discontinuity for a snapshot corresponding to the perigalacticon of a low velocity orbit . \n the disk inclination is @xmath115 . \n the horizontal axis is centered on the lmc stellar disk and oriented perpendicularly to the bow shock nose , with the shock located at @xmath116 kpc and the satellite moving towards increasing values of @xmath117 . \n the mach number derived by the temperature jump is @xmath118 , in good agreement with the theoretical value for a normal shock . \n only hot halo particles are considered in computations but , due to the sph nature of the simulations , close to the border of the disk we observe a further density increase and a sharp drop in temperature . \n the @xmath117-velocity profile is plotted in the system of reference where the pre - shock gas is at rest . \n = 8truecm    pressure profiles across the shock are plotted in fig . \n [ shockpressure ] , where @xmath119 is defined as @xmath120 . \n the total pressure remains roughly constant until the edge of the disk . \n the steep increase at @xmath121 kpc is due the rapid growth in density at the border of the disk , which is not immediately followed by a decrease in temperature . \n for @xmath122 the shock wave is inclined with respect to the initial flow velocity and the rankine - hugoniot conditions apply to the normal components of the velocity across the shock discontinuity , while the component parallel to the shock front remain unchanged . \n the flow is therefore deflected toward an oblique shock wave and the jump at the shock discontinuity is smaller . \n an edge - on ( @xmath123 ) disk behaves like a wedge moving supersonically with the vertex facing upstream . \n if the wedge angle is smaller than or equal to the maximum flow deflection angle , the oblique shock becomes attached to the vertex of the wedge and the flow is deflected so that the streamlines are parallel to the surfaces of the wedge . \n the shock standoff distance thus depends on the external density profile of the collisional edge - on disk and on the mach number of the incident flow . in both low and high velocity edge - on models the shock results almost attached to the disk \n .    figs . \n [ densitymaps][densitymaps10 ] illustrate  for different values of the inclination angle @xmath55  changes in the disk gas density distribution as the satellite passes through increasing values of the external pressure , moving towards the perigalacticon . \n each couple of panels illustrates the state of the disk at increasing ( from the top to the bottom ) times along the orbit . \n panels on the left represent hi column density maps . \n the density contrast is chosen in order to highlight the density gradient in the external disk , since the gas distribution in the central regions of the lmc is dominated by the presence of the bar and a direct comparison with pure ram - pressure simulations is not possible . \n the color scale is logarithmic , with white corresponding to a density larger than @xmath124 @xmath125 and blue to values lower than @xmath126 @xmath125 . \n hot gas particles flow on to the disk from the left to the right of each plot , with increasing ram - pressure values from the first to the fourth image . \n the disk is seen face on and rotating clockwise . in the case of the edge - on run ( fig . \n [ densitymaps ] ) cold gas particles lying in the left - bottom quadrant of the disk feel the largest ram - pressure , due to the fact that their relative velocity with respect to the external medium is maximum . \n the rotational velocity of the external disk is @xmath127 km s@xmath86 , which implies a relative velocity at the pericenter of @xmath128 km s@xmath86 ( 450 km s@xmath86 in the case of a high velocity orbit ) . \n panels on the right represent the change in mean density and radius of the gaseous external disk as a function of the azimuthal angle @xmath129 . referring to the geometry of the hi density images on the left \n , @xmath130 corresponds to the bottom of the disk and increases clockwise in such a way that the disk moves in the direction of @xmath131 . \n the gas density and the mean radius are both calculated within sections of a three dimensional annulus with internal and external radius equal to 7 and 15 kpc , respectively . \n the initial azimuthal profiles ( not represented in the plots ) are flat since both these quantities have only radial dependence . \n as soon as the satellite starts moving through the surrounding medium , the external gas density develops a peak centered on @xmath132 : disk particles localized in regions of maximum ram - pressure get compressed and move on inner orbits , while their circular velocity increases consequently . \n after about a quarter of the orbital period the gas has reached its minimum radius and maximum local density . \n the gaseous disk becomes strongly asymmetric : compression at the front edge produces a density increase along the left border of the disk , evident in the hi maps even at early times . \n the high density region forms a thin ( @xmath133 kpc ) but continuous and well defined arc which has not an equivalent in the stellar distribution . at the perigalacticon this feature extends for almost @xmath134 with a density more than one order of magnitude higher than gas located at smaller radii . \n its average thickness ( @xmath135 1.5 kpc ) and velocity dispersion along the line of sight are larger than the average values in the rest of the disk .    in the case of a satellite moving through the hot medium with an inclination angle different from @xmath136 the external pressure directed perpendicularly to the plane of the disk increases as cos@xmath55 while compression at the leading edge is much less pronounced . \n [ densitymaps45 ] and [ densitymaps10 ] refer to runs with inclination angles @xmath137 and @xmath115 . \n disks are shown face - on . \n the increment in density along the leading edge is smaller ( cool45 ) than in the edge - on model and almost absent for @xmath115 ( cool10 ) , while compression perpendicular to the plane of the disk produces local gravitational instabilities in the external gaseous disk ( also mayer , mastropietro & tran in preparation ) . \n this effect is more evident in the nearly face - on run cool10 where high density filaments delimitate regions where the local density is almost one order of magnitude lower . despite the absence of a peak in the azimuthal mean density profile , \n the integrated final density of cool10 is comparable to the other runs . \n [ dennosf ] represents the azimuthally averaged hi column density profile of the final disk configuration for the three simulations . as a result of the increase in density along the edge of the disk , \n the mean column density shows a secondary peak at large radius . \n a limb - brightened density profile has actually been observed by @xcite using the parkes multibeam hi survey of the lmc . \n the outer profiles of cool90 and cool45 are very similar , while in run cool10 the increment in density with respect to the original profile of the disk ( long - dashed red curve in the plot ) is located at larger radii ( @xmath138 kpc ) . indeed , \n due to compression of the leading edge the final gas distribution of cool90 and cool45 is asymmetric , the dense front edge being much closer to the center than the opposite border of the disk . \n therefore the hi peak in the external disk is located at relatively small radii , while the azimuthally averaged gas distribution is more extended than in the case of the run cool10 since ram pressure elongates the back side of the disk . \n again we stress the fact that our gaseous disk is more extended than it would be in a fully self consistent simulation including both gravitational and hydrodynamical forces . \n as seen in m05 and @xcite the combined effect of ram - pressure and tidal stripping is quite efficient in stripping gas from the outer satellite s disk , creating the tip of the magellanic stream already at large distances from the mw . the high density feature in cool90 \n would then form along the border of the disk at smaller radii and would not be easily subjected to further stripping due to the relatively ram - pressure values . \n [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ sfruns ]    the compressive increase in hi density is naturally associated with excess star formation . \n sph simulations can not follow the formation of molecular clouds but in first approximation the molecular gas fraction can be related to the density of atomic gas @xcite .    the main parameters of star formation simulations are summarized in table [ sfruns ] .    as we already mentioned in section 3 , \n our standard star formation model ( sf ) does not include the converging flow criterium and is characterized by an efficiency @xmath139 @xcite . \n the star formation rate parameter @xmath73 is initially set equal to @xmath140 . \n this model was adopted to run wind tube simulations with inclination angles @xmath141 ( sf90 , sf45 , sf10 ) ( table [ sfruns ] ) . \n we also investigated different star formation recipes requiring converging flows and assuming different values of @xmath73 and @xmath78 . \n we explored star formation rate parameter values in the range from 0.01 to 0.05 , that produce a star formation rate integrated over the entire disk comparable with the @xmath142 yr@xmath86 provided by @xcite . \n an efficiency @xmath143 implies that whenever a gas particle satisfies the star formation requirements , it is immediately turned into a single star particle of the same mass @xcite .    in the last six simulations listed in table [ sfruns ] we used our standard star formation model sf to investigate the effects of different orbital parameters and gas halo densities \n runs sfv400 are characterized by a maximum ram pressure value corresponding to a perigalactic velocity of 400 km s@xmath86 @xcite . such high velocity disks  when moving face - on through the external hot medium \n are strongly affected by local instabilities and star formation is consequently enhanced . \n the introduction of an artificial lower limit for the satellite gas temperature ( in runs sf10v400t12000 and sf10v400t15000 ) , higher than the cut - off in the cooling function , has the effect of reducing gravitational instabilities and fragmentation in the disk . \n this temperature threshold can be justified in order to crudely model the effect of the uv background and stellar feedback @xcite .    finally , with simulations sf90ld and sf10ld in table [ sfruns ] we also consider the possibility of a galactic hot halo ten times less dense than our standard model . \n [ inclstarform ] illustrates the state of the newly formed stellar disk at increasing times along the satellite orbit . \n each couple of rows corresponds to one of the first three runs of table [ sfruns ] and is associated with a different inclination angle @xmath55 . \n the first row of the pair represents the face - on projection of the disk with the galaxy moving towards the left of the page and the same geometry as in fig . \n [ densitymaps ] . \n time increases from the left to the right . \n each small cross indicates a new star formation event at the time of the snapshot ( within a time interval of 40 myr ) while the circle delimitates the external disk ( @xmath144 kpc ) . \n stars form in the central regions as soon as the star formation algorithm is activated , but here the star formation activity of the inner disk is not represented . \n the second row represents the total mass @xmath145 of the newly formed stars in the external disk as a function of the disk azimuthal angle @xmath129 .    in the case of a galaxy moving edge - on through the external medium ( sf90 ) , \n stars form at the leading edge of the disk when the ram - pressure becomes larger than @xmath146 dyn @xmath125 , at time @xmath147 gyr . \n the location of the star formation events initially corresponds to the hi column density peak observed in cool90 around @xmath148 ( fig . \n [ densitymaps ] ) . later on it expands along the entire front edge , creating a thin stellar arc well distinct from the star formation events that characterize the central disk . \n as soon as the satellite encounters ram pressure values comparable to those experienced by the lmc at the perigalacticon ( time @xmath149 gyr ) some episodes of star formation occur even on the back side of the disk ( last plot on the top right of fig . \n [ inclstarform ] ) , although they are not relevant in terms of new stellar mass formed . \n indeed @xmath145 shows a drastic drop at @xmath150 \n .    runs with inclination @xmath151 are characterized by significant star formation only for values of the external pressure larger than @xmath152 dyn @xmath125 . in the case of the nearly face - on run sf10 , at @xmath153 gyr star formation occurs in the entire external disk . \n ram - pressure affects the plane of the disk almost perpendicularly and stars form along the delocalized and filamentary high density structures visible in fig . \n [ densitymaps10 ] ( mayer et al . in prep . ) . \n contrary to what has been found by @xcite who focused on higher ram - pressure values ( @xmath154 cm@xmath5 and @xmath155 km s@xmath86 ) typical of the outskirts of galaxy clusters , the newly formed stars are all located in the plane of the satellite s disk ( with the exception of the high velocity face - on run sf10v400 where about 10@xmath156 of the stars forms behind the disk ) . \n the star formation events appear to be distributed nearly homogeneously along the azimuthal profile of the external disk , although a small peak in @xmath145 is observable near @xmath123 . \n in fact , the orientation of the disk with respect to its orbital motion is not exactly face - on . \n the case of the intermediate run sf45 is more complex . in a first phase , for low ram pressure values , \n star formation is produced by compression at the leading edge and a thin star formation front \n although not so well defined as in the case of a pure edge - on model \n appears on the east side of the disk . \n as soon as the external pressure reaches a critical level compression directed perpendicularly to the disk becomes the dominant mechanism driving star formation . \n + converting sfrs to h@xmath0 luminosities according to @xcite :    @xmath157    where sfr is the star formation rate averaged over the last 40 myr ( nearly two times the stellar age of 30 doradus ) , we obtain the h-@xmath0 maps illustrated in fig . \n [ lalpha ] . \n high emission regions are mainly concentrated in the external disk ( with the exception of run sfld90 where the ram - pressure exerted by the low density halo is not enough to induce star formation at the edge of the disk ) . \n the continuous stellar arc forming along the leading side of the disk in edge - on runs breaks up into several distinct and very luminous h-@xmath0 regions that more closely resemble the star - forming complexes observed on the eastern border of the lmc . the inclusion of stellar and supernovae heating  which has been neglected in the present simulations \n could prevent further star - formation around highly emitting regions and consequently produce more compact and isolated star - forming complexes . nevertheless , modeling single star - formation complexes  whose linear extension is smaller than our softening length  is beyond the scope of this paper . \n the present inclination of the lmc s disk with respect to the orbital motion is about @xmath158 ( according to the convention adopted in this paper ) . \n since the satellite is currently near a perigalactic passage we expect the h-@xmath0 map at the leading border of the disk to be something in between pure edge - on runs and the run with inclination of @xmath159 . on the other side , \n it is very likely that the disk inclination during the phase of approach to the pericenter was different . \n indeed in @xcite we have simulated the lmc s orbit according to the new proper motion measurements of @xcite and found that the cloud enters the mw halo face - on and moves almost face - on during most of the last 1 gyr . \n it turns nearly edge - on only at the perigalacticon . \n this would have a remarkable effect on the star - formation history of the external disk during the last 1 gyr and some impact also on the h-@xmath0 maps . \n indeed , although the h-@xmath0 emission would be mostly concentrated on the eastern side of the disk due to the very recent edge - on motion , we expect to see some luminous clumps forming a patchy distribution on the entire disk , due to gravitational instabilities and subsequent star - formation induced by a nearly face - on compression of the gaseous disk before 30 myr ago . \n the high velocity edge - on run sf90v400 presents a more elongated and thinner stellar arc along the leading border , with a geometry similar to that obtained increasing the star formation rate parameter to 0.05 ( sf90c0.05 ) . \n the h-@xmath0 map of sf90v400 ( third panel of the third raw ) shows two distinct luminosity peaks . \n one is located at the south - east region of the disk , roughly corresponding to the position of 30doradus and the two compact emission regions n159 and n160 . \n = 9truecm    fig . \n [ dmdt ] illustrates how the star formation rate of the external disk changes with time in the different models . \n the three black curves refer to the standard star formation runs sf , characterized by low orbital velocities . \n the edge - on disk starts forming stars earlier , but for large ram pressure values the star formation rate of sf10 and sf45 grows faster . at the perigalacticon passage sf45 has indeed a higher star formation rate than sf90 . in the case of an isolated lmc model star formation \n is almost absent for @xmath160 kpc . \n the remaining curves in fig . [ dmdt ] refer to different star formation recipes ( rows 4 - 9 of table [ sfruns ] ) . \n the location of the star formation events in the external regions of the disk does not change significantly choosing different parameters in the star formation algorithm . \n the star formation rate parameter @xmath73 determines the amount of new stars forming but does not affect the minimum threshold in ram - pressure neither the evolution of the star formation rate . in particular , in the case of edge - on runs after an initial steep increment the curve seems to converge to a constant value for increasing external pressures . \n the consequences of an increased star formation efficiency ( @xmath161 ) are almost negligible ( but not in h@xmath0 maps where only the very recent star formation rate is taken in account : compare the first panels of the first and second row ) while including the convergency requirement ( sfconv ) has nearly the same effect than reducing the star formation rate parameter of a factor two . \n = 9truecm    for convenience , the star formation rate of the last six runs of table [ sfruns ] is plotted separately ( fig . \n [ dmdtalt ] ) . the high velocity edge - on model sf90v400 \n is characterized by a steeper increment in star formation at earlier times but later on the curve flattens and the star formation rate at the perigalacticon is similar to that of the low velocity case sf90 . \n differences in h-@xmath0 maps are produced by a difference of @xmath162 m@xmath163 myr@xmath86 about time = 1 gyr . \n on the contrary , the star formation generated by compression perpendicular to the disk increases with increasing ram - pressure values ( it shows a decrement only towards the end of the simulation ) and in the case of the high velocity run sf10v400 reaches a peak @xmath164 times higher than in sf10 . \n the star formation rate of sf10v400 is strongly affected by the introduction of an artificial temperature threshold . with a temperature floor of 15000 k \n we nearly suppress star formation in the external disk . \n however , a threshold of 12000 k is already very high for a lmc model and more typical of luminous disk galaxies like the mw . \n a temperature floor lower than 10000 k would not make sense since below this temperature the cooling function adopted in the present paper drops rapidly to zero . if , as pointed out by @xcite , the satellite is moving almost face - on until it gets very close to perigalacticon , we would not expect to see star formation before 0.6 gyr independently of the orbital velocity . differences between high and low velocity runs should be marginal also near the pericenter since star formation in edge - on runs  assuming our standard prescriptions for star formation \n seems to saturate around @xmath165 m@xmath163 myr@xmath86 . \n finally , a hot halo ten times less dense than the one assumed in our favorite model would reduce drastically the star formation in a face - on lmc and suppress completely the star formation on the leading edge of the disk . \n = 9truecm    the star formation rate of the entire disk is illustrated in fig . \n [ dmdttot ] . \n this plot is only indicative since we neglect the presence of the bar and its influence on the star formation history of the satellite . \n the star formation rate of a lmc model evolved in isolation is plotted for comparison . \n the largest contribution to sfr is given by star formation events in the central region of the disk . \n curves peak between 15 and 35 m@xmath163 myr@xmath86 , comparable with observations of the magellanic clouds photometric survey ( harris et al . in prep ) . \n the total star formation rate is clearly not affected by ram - pressure before 0.4 gyr . \n indeed , after an initial sharp increment curves are rather flat despite orientation and intensity of the external pressure . an initial burst in star formation is obtained only by increasing the star formation efficiency parameter to 0.05 . for time@xmath166 0.5 gyr \n the largest deviations from an average star formation rate of @xmath167 m@xmath163 myr@xmath86 are produced in the edge -

on runs , where stars forming at the leading edge move , in time , away to the side , due to the clockwise rotation of the disk . \n the youngest stars are located at @xmath169 . \n clearly the gradient in age is much weaker in models with @xmath151 . sf10v400  with a mean stellar age of @xmath170 myr \n forms stars earlier with respect to the other nearly face - on runs , while the difference between sf90v400 and the corresponding low velocity run sf90 is about 5 myr at the leading edge and not significant in the rest of the external disk .    for the same runs we also plotted the final radial gas density profile ( fig . \n [ densf ] ) . in most of the cases \n a secondary peak is still present . \n = 8truecm    = 8truecm \n we have performed high resolution `` wind tunnel '' simulations to study the effects of ram - pressure by a tenuous galactic hot halo on the hi morphology of the lmc s disk , its recent star formation history , and location of the youngest star forming regions . \n we did not focus on the mass loss produced by ram - pressure stripping since this would also be affected by tidal interactions . for the same reason our galaxies do not form any bar and we actually start with a galaxy model very stable against bar formation so that the pure effects of external pressure are more clearly visible . \n our lmc is a multi - component system with a spherical nfw halo , an exponential stellar disk and a gaseous disk that extends up to 8 times the stellar disk scale length . in each simulation \n the external flux of hot particles increases with time as the satellite approaches the perigalacticon in such a way that the pressure experienced by the disk is consistent with the lmc s orbital velocity and an average hot halo density of @xmath93 cm@xmath5 within 150 kpc from the galactic center . \n low velocity runs are characterized by a `` classic '' pericentric velocity of 300 km s@xmath86 @xcite while high velocity runs have velocities compatible with the new proper motion measurements of @xcite . \n we expect the angle between the lmc s disk and its proper motion to vary significantly during the last billion years of orbital interaction . \n we have defined the inclination angle @xmath55 as the angle between the angular momentum vector of the disk and the flux of hot particles in the wind tube , so that the observed lmc s disk would have @xmath171 . \n @xcite performed self consistent nbody / sph simulations of the interacting system mw / lmc adopting orbital constraints from the last lmc s proper motion measurements and found that the cloud enters the mw halo face - on ( @xmath172 ) , moving nearly face - on for most of the last billion years . \n it turns edge - on only about 30 myr ago . \n this means that the lmc is moving nearly edge - on close to the perigalactic passage , corresponding to the maximum ram - pressure values , consistently with the actual disk inclination measured by @xcite . \n we have performed several simulations varying the inclination angle of the disk , the star formation recipe and the intensity of the external pressure . \n we have shown that :    * the compression of the leading border of an edge - on lmc disk can account for the high density hi region observed at the south east . in our simulations \n this high density feature is well defined ( with a mean density one order of magnitude higher than the surrounding gas ) and localized within 1.5 kpc from the border of the disk . \n its average thickness and velocity dispersion along the line of sight are larger than the average values in the rest of the disk . in cool90 \n it extends for almost @xmath134 and could also explain the origin of the spiral arm e described by @xcite , which does not have an equivalent in the stellar disk . * compression directed perpendicularly to the disk ( in runs with @xmath151 ) produces local instabilities in the gas distribution and a clumpy structure characterized by voids and high density filaments similar to those observed by the parkes multibeam hi survey ( see fig . 3 of staveley - smith et al . \n if the satellite was moving nearly face - on in the past  and according to @xcite this is likely to happened during most of the lmc / mw orbital history  ram - pressure could be responsible for the general mottled appearance of the hi disk . \n * as a result of the increase in density along the edge of the disk the mean hi column density shows a secondary peak at large radius , in agreement with observations . * the compression of the satellite s igm is naturally associated with induced star formation activity . \n we focussed on the external regions of the disk since the central parts of the real lmc would be dominated by the bar . \n edge - on disks start forming stars earlier , but for large ram - pressure values the star formation rate of runs with @xmath151 grows much faster . \n the high velocity edge - on model sf90v400 is characterized by a steeper increment in star formation at earlier times but later on the curve flattens and the star formation rate at the perigalacticon is similar to that of the low velocity case sf90 . \n on the other hand , the star formation generated by a compression perpendicular to the lmc s disk increases with increasing ram - pressure values and in the case of the high velocity run sf10v400 reaches a peak @xmath164 times higher than in sf10 . \n if the satellite is moving almost face - on until it gets very close to the perigalacticon we would expect not to see star formation before 0.6 gyr independently of the orbital velocity . \n differences between high and low velocity runs should be marginal also near the pericenter since star formation in edge - on runs  assuming our standard prescriptions  seems to saturate around @xmath165 m@xmath163 myr@xmath86 . * in edge - on models the star formation of the external disk is characterized by a thin stellar arc along the leading border , well distinct from the star formation events in the central disk . if sfr is converted in h@xmath0 luminosities , this arc breaks in several distinct and very luminous h@xmath0 regions that more closely resemble the star forming complexes observed on the eastern border of the disk . \n although the h@xmath0 emission is mostly concentrated on the eastern side as a consequence of the very recent edge - on motion , we expect to see some luminous clumps forming a patchy distribution on the entire disk , due to gravitational instabilities and subsequent star formation induced by a nearly face - on compression of the disk before 30 myr ago . as observed by @xcite stellar complexes on the leading edge show a progression in age in the clockwise direction , but a face -

\n the dual mixer , dual - channel receiver was tuned to observe the molecules listed with their respective frequencies , beamwidths and velocity resolutions in table  [ tb : linpars ] . \n the frequency - switching mode was used to obtain the observations , and system temperatures were 150 - 200  k. the chopper wheel method was used for calibration . \n the spectrometer is an autocorrelator configured to give the velocity resolutions listed in table  [ tb : linpars ] . \n beam efficiencies were @xmath2 0.75 for the lower frequency 80 - 115  ghz range , and @xmath2 0.6 for the higher frequency 197 - 266  ghz range . \n observations were made in a grid with a reference position at , . \n hco@xmath0 ,  and  were uniformly sampled such that a region centered on the reference position was observed every 24@xmath7 out to a maximum distance of 96 @xmath7 in right ascension and 120@xmath7 in declination , a total of 9 @xmath8 11 or 99 spectra for each species . \n this grid spacing is approximately one beamwidth , slightly over for hco@xmath0  and under for c@xmath1o . \n the n@xmath9h@xmath0  and cs emission was much weaker and less extended so the grid size was reduced to 5 @xmath8 5 around the reference point with an additional two measurements directly north , east , south and west of the center , resulting in a total of 33 spectra for these species . \n the spacing between measurements was also 24@xmath7 , approximately one beamwidth for each of the molecules . \n data reduction was done using the standard iram package class and idl ( interactive data language by research systems , inc . ) . \n figure [ spec ] shows the ,  and  spectra at the reference position . \n the cs and hco@xmath0 profiles display a split asymmetric , double - peaked shape while the c@xmath1o line is single - peaked , though slightly asymmetric . \n the c@xmath1o line appears to bisect the cs and hco@xmath0 profiles in velocity indicating that the two latter lines are likely optically thick and self - reversed . \n the blue - shifted sense of the self - absorption in the self - reversals is indicative of expansion motions in the outer cloud layers . \n individual spectra of the hco@xmath0 and  emission from across  are simultaneously displayed in figure [ c18ohcomap ] for comparison . \n examination of the figure shows similar double - peaked , self - reversed hco@xmath0 emission profiles at several positions around the center of the globule . in all cases \n the sense of the asymmetry is the same suggesting expansion of the outer cloud layers . in most other positions the hco@xmath0 lines display blue - shifted self - absorption relative to c@xmath1o , also consistent with expansion motions .    as can be seen in figure [ c18ocsmap ] cs spectra \n are also clearly self - reversed with blue - shifted self - absorption similar to the hco@xmath0 lines in positions where the hco@xmath0 was also self - reversed , but the signals have lower intensity . similar to hco@xmath0 , the other cs spectra appear to exhibit asymmetric profiles relative to c@xmath1o with a sense indicative of expansion motions . the critical density ( @xmath10 @xmath11 ) \n at which cs emission occurs is the same as that for hco@xmath0 emission ( ungerechts et al . \n 1997 ) so it is reasonable to assume that the two emission lines probe the same layer of material in the cloud . \n a rough estimate of the expansion speed of material was determined by comparing the velocity of the stronger hco@xmath0  peak to the peak velocity of a c@xmath1o  spectrum at the same position . \n the peak velocities were obtained by fitting gaussian line profiles to the spectral lines . \n this resulted in velocity differences which are all negative confirming that the blueshifted profiles are characteristic of expansion , and indicating that material is expanding in the cloud over the whole layer under observation with a mean expansion velocity of -0.09 @xmath12 0.04  km  s@xmath13 . \n the same process was applied to the cs spectra and the velocity differences were also found to be negative everywhere with a mean difference ( expansion velocity ) of -0.12 @xmath12 0.02 km  s@xmath13 . \n this is similar to the range of @xmath14 for hco@xmath0 . \n this expanding motion is therefore also evident in the cs line emission profiles . \n another estimate of the expansion speed of material within the cloud was obtained using the model of @xcite . \n this model can only be applied to positions ( 10 positions ) where there is a clear double peak . in this model , \n the expansion velocity , @xmath15 is given by , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the brightness temperature of the dip , @xmath18 is the height of the blue peak above the dip with its corresponding velocity , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the height of the red peak above the dip with its corresponding velocity , @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the velocity dispersion of an optically thin line ( c@xmath1o  here ) . for the hco@xmath0  lines , \n the mean expansion speed was calculated to be -0.07 @xmath12 0.02 and and for the cs lines , -0.07 @xmath12 0.02 km s@xmath13 ; both these estimates are somewhat lower than those derived from the peak velocity difference method in the previous paragraph . \n nonetheless , though somewhat uncertain , the overall expansion speeds we estimate are formally less than the one dimensional sound speed of @xmath23 0.19 km s@xmath13 in a 10 k gas . \n figure  [ c18opkv ] shows maps of the variation of the velocity of the peak in the c@xmath1o  spectra . \n the peak velocities were determined from gaussian fits to the line profiles . \n we note that a few of the  and  lines are flat - topped , broadened or slightly asymmetric , indicating that the lines are slightly optically thick . \n the two maps , however , do reveal a systematic velocity gradient increasing from upper left to lower right of the map .    to estimate the magnitude and direction of this gradient , the method of @xcite \n was used as adapted by @xcite . \n the velocity gradient is assumed to be linear when projected against the plane of the sky so the observed velocity @xmath24 can be related to the velocity gradient @xmath25 using @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28 are right ascension and declination offsets in arcseconds . \n @xmath29 is the systemic velocity of the cloud and @xmath30 is the angle between north and the direction of the velocity gradient of magnitude @xmath25 . \n a least - squares fit of a two - dimensional plane to the observed @xmath24 ( line center velocity ) measurements of , and  ( the  spectra contained hyperfine components , and so the isolated component at the same @xmath24 as the  line was used in this analysis ) provided estimates given in table [ tb : velgradfit ] . \n the errors for the n@xmath9h@xmath31 are larger because there were only nine spectra measured that were useful for this purpose . \n the n@xmath9h@xmath0  emission was less extended than the c@xmath1oemission , therefore , more densely sampled observations are needed to confirm the estimates using the n@xmath9h@xmath31 data .    if the velocity gradient derived previously is removed , the average velocity difference between the neighboring spectra is then essentially zero ( @xmath32 km s@xmath13 ) . \n line widths ( fwhp ) were determined from gaussian fits to the observed  and  line profiles . \n the  spectra have several hyperfine components so the line widths were determined from a gaussian fit to the isolated ( @xmath33 ) component . \n the resulting  and  line widths were found to be in a range from @xmath2  0.19 to @xmath2  0.35  km  s@xmath13 . \n the n@xmath9h@xmath0  line widths were narrower , and were in the range @xmath2 0.15 to @xmath2  0.25 km s@xmath13 . \n figure  [ c18olnw ] shows the variation in line width of the  line profiles \n . because some of these lines are optically thick ( see comment in   [ sec : vel ] ) , the line widths determined from a single gaussian fit are slightly larger than they would be if the lines were optically thin . \n nevertheless , the line widths seem to increase slightly at positions away from the highly extincted region around offset ( 24@xmath7 ,  0@xmath7 ) , marked with a white cross in figure  [ c18olnw ] . \n this is similar to b68 where the linewidths also appeared to increase away from its center . \n the reason for this is not clear . \n no independent measure of the kinetic temperature of  has as yet been made ; a value of 10  k has therefore been adopted in this paper because data has shown that this applies to most globules and dense cores ( e.g. , @xcite ) . \n the thermal line width , @xmath34 $ ] for lines was therefore calculated to be 0.123  km  s@xmath13 , and for n@xmath9h@xmath0lines , 0.125  km  s@xmath13 . the nonthermal contribution to the line width was then estimated using the relation , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the observed line width , @xmath37 is the thermal line width and @xmath38 is the nonthermal line width . \n the resulting average nonthermal line width for the lines was @xmath2  0.25  km  s@xmath13 , and for the n@xmath9h@xmath0  lines , @xmath2  0.15  km  s@xmath13 . \n to the extent that these lines are optically thin , this suggests that in producing the observed line profiles , nonthermal broadening mechanisms , e.g. , turbulence , may play a role . \n there may be more turbulent motion in the outer layers probed by the c@xmath1o  molecular lines than in the inner more dense layers probed by the n@xmath9h@xmath0  line . \n however , the corresponding one dimensional non - thermal velocity dispersions ( @xmath39 ) are 0.11 and 0.06 km  s@xmath13 for the c@xmath1o  and n@xmath9h@xmath0  emitting gas , respectively . these values are both subsonic , that is , less than the one dimensional sound speed ( 0.19 km  s@xmath13 ) in a 10 k gas .      in figure 6 \n we show contour maps of c@xmath1o ( 10 ) , n@xmath9h@xmath0 ( 10 ) , and hco@xmath0 ( 10 ) integrated emission overlaid on a grey - scale map of the distribution of visual extinction . \n the extinction map was constructed from the data of alves et al . \n ( 2002 ) and convolved with a 24 arc sec gaussian smoothing kernel to match the resolution of the molecular - line data . \n the patterns seen in this figure are comparable to those seen in numerous other low - mass pre - stellar cores such as b68 or l1544 ( bergin et al . \n 2002 ; tafalla et al . \n in particular , both c@xmath1o and hco@xmath0 show emission distributions that are broader than the distribution in extinction with peaks well separated from the extinction maximum . \n in contrast n@xmath9h@xmath0 shows the highest degree of agreement with the dust extinction . \n this pattern is attributed to the freeze - out of molecules on the surfaces of cold dust grains in gas where the density exceeds 10@xmath40 @xmath11 ( e.g. bergin & langer 1997 ; aikawa et al . 2005 ) . in this scenario \n the freeze - out of co and its isotopologues leads to the formation of n@xmath9h@xmath0 in the dense gas dominated by freeze - out and traced by the dust . \n hco@xmath41 has structure similar to co which is not surprising since hco@xmath0 likely forms from gas phase reactions involving co. for a summary of this process in starless cores see bergin & tafalla ( 2007 ) . \n one explanation for the expansion of material from  could be that the globule is simply unbound . \n this might be expected if the core is a transitory feature in a global turbulent sea @xcite . in this section \n , we assess this possibility by determining whether or not the core is bound . a mass for  of @xmath42 ^ 2 $ ] @xmath43 was derived by spatially integrating the extinction data over the area of the globule , after correcting for a significant foreground / background extinction component ( a@xmath44 @xmath2 6 magnitudes ) and an assumed distance of @xmath45  pc . \n the magnitude of the background extinction was derived from examination of the azmuthially averaged extinction profile of the globule constructed from the alves et al . \n ( 2002 ) deep extinction data and is the same as that derived by alves et al . \n ( 2007 ) for this core from a wavelet decomposition of their 2mass extinction map of the pipe cloud . \n the escape velocity ( @xmath46 $ ] ) from  is estimated to be @xmath47@xmath48^{0.5}$ ] km s@xmath13 . \n the average three - dimensional velocity dispersion ( @xmath49 ) of the bulk gas in the globule is @xmath2 0.3 - 0.4  km  s@xmath13 , and significantly less than the escape velocity . \n thus the globule is likely to be gravitationally bound for the assumed distance of 130 pc or for any other plausible distance to the cloud . \n moreover , the expansion speeds detected in the self - absorbed molecular line data ( @xmath2 0.1 km s@xmath13 , see   [ sec : hco ] ) are also significantly less than the calculated escape speed . \n the expansion of the outer layers of the globlule appears not to be caused simply by evaporation of its gas as in an unbound , transient cloud . \n a jeans mass of @xmath50m@xmath51 was derived using @xmath52m@xmath53 where @xmath54 is the globule s kinetic temperature assumed to be @xmath2 10  k. however , if we assume the lines are only thermally broadened , with no turbulence , then the kinetic temperature is 17  k and this doubles the jeans mass estimate (   [ sec : linwid ] ) . \n the average density @xmath55=@xmath56 @xmath11 was determined using the extinction data and a radius , @xmath57 cm . \n the radius was determined to be the point at which the radially averaged extinction profile reaches the background and marks the outer edge of the globule . \n since the mass of  is comparable to its jeans mass , we conclude that it is likely marginally stable against gravitational collapse . if thermal pressure is not the only source of internal support then the globule could be even more stable against collapse . \n more detailed analysis of the globule s structure would be required to better evaluate its overall stability \n .      there may be some contribution to stability of the globule from rotation . \n assuming solid body rotation , @xmath58 , the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to gravitational energy , is given by @xcite ,    @xmath59    @xmath60 is the globule s radius , @xmath61 its mass and @xmath62 is defined such that the moment of inertia , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is defined such that the gravitational potential energy is @xmath65 . \n @xmath58 was estimated to be 0.01 for  using @xmath66m@xmath67 cm , @xmath68 [ 1.5  km  s@xmath13  pc@xmath13]/@xmath70 ( for , see table  [ tb : velgradfit ] ) , where @xmath71 is the inclination of the globule to the line of sight , and assuming @xmath72 as for a sphere with a density profile @xmath73 and @xmath74 . \n the contribution of rotation to the overall stability of  is therefore not significant . \n note that @xmath58 of 0.01 is also consistent with the results of @xcite that most clouds have @xmath75 . \n thermal motions may be a significant source of pressure support for . \n this can be quantified by evaluating the ratio of thermal to nonthermal ( turbulent ) pressure given by ,    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the one dimensional isothermal sound speed and @xmath39 is the one dimensional nonthermal or turbulent velocity dispersion and @xmath78 $ ] . assuming a gas temperature of 10 k , the average value of @xmath79 for all the c@xmath1o observations is 3.75 @xmath12 1.95 , which may be an underestimate for those lines that may be somewhat thick . \n the average value of @xmath79 for the n@xmath9h@xmath0data is 6.09 @xmath12 2.07 . \n these values indicate that the thermal pressure significantly exceeds the turbulent pressure in the globule , and absent strong static magnetic fields , is the dominant source of internal support against gravity .    in comparing the turbulent velocity dispersion to the isothermal sound speed of 0.19  km  s@xmath13 in a 10  k molecular gas , \n the nonthermal motions appear to be subsonic over the surface of . \n if the n@xmath9h@xmath0  observations probe a deeper layer of the globule than the c@xmath1o  lines , these motions are even more subsonic in the inner layers of the globule . \n these considerations further indicate that thermal motions provide a significant source of internal pressure . \n the apparent velocity gradient in the c@xmath1o  data was calculated and removed in \n [ sec : vel ] . \n the resulting average velocity difference between neighboring spectra was essentially zero ( ) so there appears to be no residual scatter in peak velocities of the spectra on scale sizes comparable to the beam width that could be caused by turbulent motions . \n this also is consistent with significant thermal support for the globule .      in the absence of an embedded source in  that could cause outflow of material , \n it is difficult to explain the observations reported here . in the previous section we showed that the globule is gravitationally bound with thermal pressure as the dominant source of internal support . \n but what causes the observed expansion motions ? the facts that 1- the globule \n is bound , 2- thermally supported and 3- does not exceed the jean s mass , suggest that this core is stable and not far from a state of hydrostatic equilibrium . \n moreover , the expected ( one - dimensional ) virial velocity dispersion , @xmath80 $ ] , is 0.18 km s@xmath13 and is comparable to the sound speed in a 10 k gas as would be expected for a thermally dominated , stable core . \n indeed , we derive the velocity dispersion for the h@xmath9 gas in the core to be @xmath81 0.21 km s@xmath13 close to the predicted value \n . however , given that its outer layers are globally expanding , the globule can not be presently in a strict equilibrium state . \n one viable explanation that can simultaneously account for all these facts , is that  is in dynamical oscillation around an equilibrium state . \n the outflowing motion is then part of a mode of oscillation such that its layers pulse in and out with a period of possibly a few hundred thousand years . \n we further explore this interesting possibility below .    in their study of molecular lines observed in the globule b68 , \n @xcite concluded that that globule could be experiencing low order mode , nonradial oscillations of its outer layers . \n they suggest that the globule may have interacted with the shock of a supernova remnant , which instigated a perturbation that set at least its outer layers in oscillatory motion . \n figure  7 of their paper displays the real parts of the spherical harmonic functions for a range of low order modes for an oscillating sphere . \n the @xmath82 mode corresponds closely to the pattern observed in b68 . \n a study by @xcite demonstrated that linear perturbations on a pressure - bounded thermally supported sphere could indeed produce the spatial variation in profile shape observed in b68 \n .  could also be oscillating in this mode but the geometry is such that we are looking ` edge - on ' to the pulsating cloud . \n this means the mode of pulsation appears similar to the ` breathing ' or @xmath83 mode , i.e. , outflow motion over the whole surface of the cloud @xcite . \n calculations were carried out to find the modes of pulsation for an isothermal , spherical globule of gas with similar parameters ( e.g. , radius = @xmath84 cm , density = @xmath85 @xmath11 , internal sound speed = 0.18  km  s@xmath13 ) as for . \n small wave - like perturbations were introduced , and a differential wave equation was determined using the perturbed and unperturbed forms of its equations of state . \n the modes of oscillation postulated are likely to be acoustic , with relatively large amplitudes and energies , so that the linear approximation that we use for the mode frequencies is a simplification of the full dynamical problem . in this linear approximation , we ignore the gravitational modes , and find that the acoustic modes follow the dispersion relation    @xmath86 \\right ) } { j_l \\left ( x_{\\omega } \\left [ c_{out}/c_{in } \\right ] \\right ) } = 0\\ ] ]    @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the frequency of the oscillations ; @xmath89 is the unperturbed radius ; @xmath90 are isothermal sound speeds inside and outside the globule respectively ; @xmath91 are the unperturbed densities inside and outside the globule respectively ; and , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are spherical hankel and bessel functions of the first kind or order @xmath94 , with the prime denoting differentiation with respect to the argument . \n the frequency @xmath88 is complex and roots of the dispersion relation where @xmath88 has a negative imaginary part , correspond to decaying modes of oscillation . \n the required mode for pulsation is the least - damped mode or the mode which decays at the slowest rate ; this is the mode with the smallest negative imaginary part of @xmath88 . \n this mode was calculated to be @xmath95 with a frequency of @xmath96 hz corresponding to an oscillation period of @xmath97  years , comparable to the sound crossing time . \n it is plausible that this oscillation was excited by some transient dynamical event , such as a shock , that deposits an energy greater than about @xmath98  ergs , ( our best estimate of the kinetic energy in coherent motions ) into the outer regions of , where hco@xmath0  molecules exhibit a coherent pattern of expansion motions . \n calculations by @xcite show that such large amplitude motions ( i.e. , motions comparable to the sound speed ) can cause significant geometrical distortions of a core . an important point to note \n is that in the high resolution extinction map of  obtained by @xcite , a slight splitting of the core s central regions is visible . \n this splitting could be another manifestation of an @xmath95 mode of oscillation . \n is situated in the direction of the pipe nebula , which lies at the edge of the scorpio centaurus ob association . \n @xcite suggested that stellar wind from the b0 type star @xmath99  sco caused compression of the molecular gas , triggering star formation in the b59 cloud , situated @xmath2  5@xmath100 west and @xmath2  3@xmath100 north of . in figure  5 of their paper , @xcite show an observation of , designating it ` core 12 ' . in discussing the effect of the ob stars on the pipe nebula \n , @xcite estimated that @xmath101 ergs has been deposited in the cloud over a period of @xmath102 years . \n if  is indeed near this ob association and was also able to intercept only 0.3% of the estimated energy deposition , then the effects of the postulated shock waves may be more widespread than previously speculated . \n not only did they trigger star formation in b59 , but they may have also set gaseous globules such as  and b68 ( which is also part of the pipe complex ) into oscillation . \n more observations and comparison with theoretical models of cloud pulsation are needed to confirm this hypothesis .      in figure 7 \n we provide a direct comparison of the dependence of c@xmath1o ( 10 ) and n@xmath9h@xmath0 ( 10 ) emission with visual extinction at the same angular resolution . for both species the figures display trends that are similar to those seen in b68 by bergin et al . \n ( 2002 ) . in these plots \n , a linear correlation between integrated intensity and a@xmath44 corresponds to a constant abundance throughout the cloud . \n the c@xmath1o ( 10 ) emission shows a linear dependence with a@xmath44 until @xmath103 mag whereupon the trend flattens . \n given the drop in the the c@xmath1o integrated emission / a@xmath44 relation near a@xmath104 mag we have fit the following function : @xmath105 to the data . \n we find an intercept of @xmath106 k km s@xmath13 and a slope of @xmath107    thus for a@xmath108 12@xmath109 , where we see a significant linear correlation between gas emission and dust extinction , we estimate a c@xmath1o abundance of @xmath110 ( relative to h@xmath9 ) . \n this is comparable to that measured previously by frerking , langer , & wilson ( 1982 ) of @xmath111 in taurus and to that obtained from a similar comparison of extinction and co measurements toward l 977 ( alves et al . \n for a@xmath112 the correlation is essentially flat , indicative of saturation or , as in b68 , a drop in abundance towards denser regions . \n we can use the intercept to estimate average abundance in this gas and find that the abundance is @xmath113 between 20 and 40 magnitudes . \n thus , we estimate that co is depleted by a factor of @xmath25 . in  3.2 we noted that the c@xmath1o emission lines show indications of being slightly optically thick . \n thus these abundance estimates are upper limits to the _ average _ depletion in the cloud . \n the situation for n@xmath9h@xmath0 ( 10 ) in figure 7 is more complicated . \n there is a rough correspondence between integrated emission and a@xmath44 and it is well fit by a line with a slope of 0.106@xmath120.001 k km s@xmath13 mag@xmath13 and an intercept of -0.711@xmath120.031 k km s@xmath13 . \n this is consistent with an abundance of 10@xmath114 relative to hydrogen . \n however , we can not exclude the possibility that the trend becomes flat at @xmath115  mag . \n fits to the intensities of the hyperfine lines of  suggest that the total opacities are of order 12 at the emission peaks , so that all the hyperfine components are saturated . \n this is not the case at low a@xmath44 , where the lines appear to be optically thin . \n thus we believe that the line integrated intensity-@xmath116 correlation may be turning over at high a@xmath44 as a result of saturation and rather than depletion . \n however , we also note that the spatial map of n@xmath9h@xmath0 in figure 6 displays peaks northeast and southwest of the dust extinction peak and this could also be an indication of depletion of this species similar to what has been observed in b68 ( bergin et al . \n however , due to the high opacity of the line , it is not possible to separate the effects of spatial variations in excitation from those of column density without detailed chemical modeling . \n high resolution radio observations were made of the globule . \n molecular lines observed were , , , and . \n the hco@xmath0  and cs spectra showed clear self - reversed , asymmetric profiles across the face of the globule . \n the sense of the asymmetry is indicative of the presence of global expansion motions across the globule . \n these motions appear to be subsonic and significantly below the escape speed of the cloud . \n a search for iras , msx sources and spitzer sources showed the globule to be starless , and therefore the origins of these expansion motions is unclear .    in this paper \n , we propose the explanation that the globule is in a quasi - stable state near hydrodynamic equilibrium such that its outer layers are pulsating . \n it is possible that a passing shock wave from a nearby ob star association has excited the globule setting its outer layers into motion . \n such oscillatory motion is visible in the layers on the sun ( where the fundamental radial period is @xmath2 1 hour and other oscillation periods are @xmath2 5 minutes ) but in , the periods are thought to be of the order of hundreds of thousands of years . \n this is similar to what @xcite observed in b68 . \n calculations to determine the dominant mode of pulsation resulted in an @xmath95 mode with a frequency of @xmath96 hz , and an oscillation period of @xmath97 years . \n a high resolution extinction map of  exhibits a double peak structure at the highest levels of opacity , corresponding to visual extinctions of @xmath250 mag @xcite . \n it is possible that the proposed @xmath95 mode of oscillation could explain the observed splitting of the core in this column density map .    finally , we find evidence for significant depletion of co and perhaps hco@xmath0  in this globule . however ,  may be undepleted to depths of about 40 magnitudes of visual extinction in the core of the cloud . \n we are grateful to dr . \n tracy huard and

scale ( @xmath5 3  mm ) loops , while large - scale loop system was present on the left side of p. this asymmetry may lead to the formation of an extended magnetic canopy above the small - scale emerging dynamic fields on the right side of cluster p.    in figures [ cuta ] and [ cutb ] , we show x - t plots made along the cuts a and b ( figure [ ha_irim ] , dotted lines ) . in each figure \n , the top panel is an h@xmath0 - 0.1  nm x - t plot , while the bottom panel is an x - t plot of irim stokes v data . \n a total of 364 h@xmath0 - 0.1  nm images were used to produce the top panel with the slit width of 6 pixels ( 0.23  mm ) . \n the bottom panel was produced from 94 irim magnetograms and a 2.9  mm slit was used . in both top panels , \n the darkest h@xmath0 - 0.1  nm x - t features were outlined by a yellow contour at an arbitrary intensity level . \n the dashed line segments highlight several steep x - t tracks representing an upward motion of rbes . \n the lower end of the line segments ( or dark tracks ) marks the occurrence time and the initial position of the event along the slit . \n similarly , the lower part of the areas , enclosed by the contours , represent roots of rbes , while the upper part are rbe tips . \n we would like to stress that the level of rbe activity at these cuts is intermittent rather than constant : periods of enhanced rbe production are separated by long intervals of relative quietude ( figure [ cuta ] and [ cutb ] ) . \n a new period of rbe activity usually begins with the development of a dark jet - like feature , followed by series of increasingly thinner and fainter rbes ( see the h@xmath0 - 0.1  nm x - t intervals between t=39  min and t=45  min , t=64  min and t=70  min in figure [ cuta ] and t=38  44  min and t=94  99  min in figure [ cutb ] ) . \n we overplotted the contours and tracks on the irim x - t plots shown in the lower panels of figures [ cuta ] and [ cutb ] . \n there appears to be a tendency for the groups of rbes ( and not necessary individual tracks ) to occur when a new magnetic flux appears in the photosphere . by using a parabola , we outlined the several most prominent episodes of enhanced rbe activity associated with underlying dynamical changes in the magnetic field such as the appearance of mixed and/or unipolar fields . \n the first parabola in figure [ cuta ] has its apex set at x=0.7  mm and t=38  min , when clear and persisting magnetic field changes began to occur at a location x. in this particular case , the magnetic field at x=0.7 mm was mostly weak ( grey ) before positive ( white ) polarity patch appeared at approx t=38 min . \n as the patch grew ( t=40 - 44  min ) , some negative polarity fields appeared within the slice as well . at the same time , series of rbes occurred with their long and dark , possibly highly inclined h@xmath0 - 0.1  nm tracks stopping approx . 0.7  mm short of the center of the positive polarity patch . \n note that data , presented in @xcite , suggests that roots of ca ii 824.5  nm rbes tend to be located lower in the chromosphere and closer to magnetic field concentrations , as compared to the roots of h@xmath0  rbes . \n the difference can be as large as 1.5  mm so that the real plasma outflows in the above example may originated much closer to the network flux concentrations . \n the apex of the second parabola marks emergence of a negative polarity ( black ) fields . \n it is not clear whether two sets of rbes that occurred between t=64 and t=67 min are related to this emergence episode since the t=66 min track could have originated at x=3.2 mm as the dashed line suggests ( top panel ) . \n however , the third group of rbes that began at t=68  min seems to be temporally and spatially correlated with the new negative flux . \n note that an emerging bipole may not always have its poles of equal intensity , or its axis parallel to the cut lines shown in fig . \n 1 . in this case \n only one polarity will appear in the slice , while the other polarity could be either outside the slice , masked by the surrounding the same polarity fields , or be much weaker and less pronounced . however , the most important observation is that the appearance of a new ( bi- or mono - polar ) flux at a given location , which suggests ongoing restructuring of the surrounding chromospheric fields as the new flux makes its way into the solar atmosphere . \n the first parabola in figure [ cutb ] has its apex at t=36  min , when we assume the new bipole was beginning to emerge . \n the bipole showed signs of development ( flux increase , some pole separation ) and a prolonged series of rbes appeared in association with the emergence . \n the second parabola in figure [ cutb ] at t=67  min and x=1  mm envelops what looks like an emerging bipole associated with two sets of enhanced rbe activity . \n the rbe activity associated with the third flux emergence event ( x=2.5  mm , t=87  min ) was significantly ( 8  min ) delayed relative to the first appearance of the negative polarity patch . \n a common denominator in all these events is that the emergence of a new magnetic flux seems to be accompanied by enhanced production of rbes , whereas essentially no , or very weak , rbe activity is observed in `` gray '' areas occupied by the unipolar or weak mixed fields ( e.g. , between t=55  min and t=85  min and x @xmath5 1.5  mm , figure [ cuta ] and between t=62  min and t=75  min and x @xmath6 5  mm , figure [ cutb ] ) . \n these figures also suggest that rbe activity tends be delayed and often starts 2 - 5  min after the first signatures of the emerging flux appear . \n this time lag is long enough for emerging loops to reach the chromosphere , assuming that their average ascending rate is about 12  @xmath7 or higher @xcite . \n we thus argue that rbe ( spicule ii ) activity analysed here was caused by emergence of small - scale dipoles in close proximity to and around network field concentrations . \n in figure [ case ] we show an example of rbe activity ( background ) and the underlying evolution of magnetic fields ( contours ) . the first contour is plotted at the level of @xmath830  g , which corresponds to the 2@xmath9 level of the data set . \n the red cross in figure [ case ] mark the location of emergence of a new negative polarity element , which occurred within the positive polarity fields at the edge of network cluster p ( also marked in figure [ ha_irim ] ) . \n the new element rapidly developed between 19:16:29  ut and 19:17:14  ut , and was later accompanied by a dark jet like feature that peaked around 19:18:44  ut and a short lived ( @xmath5 2  min ) h@xmath0 - 0.1  nm brightening ( arrow ) . by that time \n the negative polarity element has already weakened , and it has disappeared by 19:22:28  ut . \n @xcite reported that the simulated emerging flux may be subject to magnetic reconnection with the pre - existing fields , which results in plasma acceleration and emission of high - frequency waves that propagate into the corona . \n based on that agreement and the data presented above , we argue that at least some rbes ( spicules ii ) are due to reconnection between the ubiquitous small - scale emerging fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ? \n * ; * ? ? ? \n * ) and the pre - existing `` open '' ( or large - scale closed ) fields associated with network clusters .    in figure [ kinks ] \n we show three jet events that exhibit signatures of magnetic reconnection . \n these images are from the h@xmath0 - 0.1  nm data set acquired near the solar north pole . \n the shape of these jets is similar to those produced in simulations of reconnection of emerging flux and pre - existing large - scale fields ( see e.g. , figure 3 in @xcite and figure 1 in @xcite ) . \n event 1 ( see also * ? ? ? \n * ) appears to be rooted at point a. point x marks the location where field lines bend above what might be a reconnection point , and the arc between a and x is spanning the presumed emerging dipole . at about 18:03  ut a small low contrast brightening ( arrow in the middle panel ) developed just below x. shortly after , point b retracted back and the jet faded from the fov . \n event 2 ( middle column ) appeared to be an inverted `` y '' shaped jet , which is a signature of reconnection as well @xcite . \n it first appeared as a straight short rbe , while one minute later a brightening ( arrow ) and a small second leg have developed . \n it is unlikely that the second leg of an inverted `` y '' was an intergranular lane , because of its short life time ( @xmath102  min ) and synchronous evolution with the jet . event 3 ( right column ) initially appeared as a typical curved rbe , however , it has later developed a kink ( middle panel ) that rapidly evolved . \n we would like to point out that because of their extremely short life time , these events were seen only in 3 - 4 consecutive frames taken 10  s apart . \n all events faded from the fov some 20  s after the time of the last corresponding frames in figure [ kinks ] . \n in this letter , we present observational evidence that support the idea of the origin of rbes ( type ii spicules ) being in reconnection . \n the data suggest that occurrence of series of rbes is generally correlated with instances of new flux emergence near the edge of a cluster of unipolar network fields . in this case , a large and dark jet - like features first appear , followed by numerous shorter and thinner jets . more specifically , we report that in these particular data sets i ) rbes tend to occur at an interface between large - scale ( `` open '' ) flux of a network fields and small - scale dynamic magnetic loops ; ii ) rbe occurrence is likely to be associated with the existence of a magnetic canopy ; iii ) there is a temporal correlation between the appearance of new magnetic flux and periods on enhanced rbe activity , and iv ) some rbes display kink or inverse `` y '' shape . \n the data suggests that at least some of rbes ( type ii spicules ) are due to the interchange type of reconnection between the large - scale fields and the emerging small - scale fields . \n namely , emerging magnetic dipoles reconnect with the ambient network fields in the manner of a standard x - ray jet or a blow - out jet @xcite . \n we further speculate that the reconnection may proceed in the form of oscillatory reconnection consisting of series of elementary reconnection events each generating plasma outflows , and high frequency waves @xcite \n . an additional possibility may be that reconnection with emerging dipoles removes flux from a bundle of flux tubes , thus inducing their rapid equilibrium reconfiguration . \n the disturbance may additionally generate both small scale ( component ) reconnection and high frequency mhd waves as proposed by @xcite , which may ( along with oscillatory reconnection ) account for the appearance of smaller and thinner spicules ii as well as their group oscillations . \n authors thank t.  j. okamoto , b. de pontieu , t.  j. wang and h. tian for valuable discussions . \n this work was conducted as part of the effort of nasa s living with a star focused science team `` jets '' . \n we thank bbso observing and engineering staff for support and observations . \n this research was supported by nasa grants gi nnx08aj20 g , lws nnx08aq89 g , nnx11ao73 g , as well as nsf ags-1146896 grant . \n , w. , goode , p.  r. , ahn , k. , gorceix , n. , schmidt , w. , & lin , h. 2012 , in astronomical society of the pacific conference series , vol . \n 463 , astronomical society of the pacific conference series , ed . \n t.  r. rimmele , a.  tritschler , f.  wger , m.  collados vera , h.  socas -
